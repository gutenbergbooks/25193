  ACADEMY.</h2>

  <h3>HENRY FUSELI.</h3>

  <p>At a time when the eye of the public is more remarkably, and we
  trust more kindly, directed to the Fine Arts, we may do some service
  to the good cause, by reverting to those lectures delivered in the
  Royal Academy, composed in a spirit of enthusiasm honourable to the
  professors, but which kindled little sympathy in an age strangely
  dead to the impulses of taste. The works, therefore, which set forth
  the principles of art, were not read extensively at the time, and had
  little influence beyond the walls within which they were delivered.
  Favourable circumstances, in conjunction with their real merit, have
  permanently added the discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds to the
  standard literature of our country. They have been transferred from
  the artist to the scholar; and so it has happened, that while few of
  any pretension to scholarship have not read the &quot;The
  Discourses,&quot; they have not, as they should have, been
  continually in the hands of artists themselves. To awaken a feeling
  for this kind of professional reading&#8212;yet not so professional
  as not to be beneficial&#8212;reflectingly upon classical learning;
  indeed, we might say, education in general, and therefore more
  comprehensive in its scope&#8212;we commenced our remarks on the
  discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds, which have appeared in the pages
  of Maga. There are now more than symptoms of the departure of that
  general apathy which prevailed, when most of the Academy lectures
  were delivered. It will be, therefore, a grateful, and may we hope a
  useful, task, by occasional notices to make them more generally
  known.</p>

  <p>The successors of Reynolds labour under a twofold disadvantage;
  they find that he has occupied the very ground they would have taken,
  and written so ably and fully upon all that is likely to obtain a
  general interest, as to leave a prejudice against further attempts.
  Of necessity, there must be, in every work treating of the same
  subject, much repetition; and it must require no little ingenuity to
  give a novelty and variety, that shall yet be safe, and within the
  bounds of the admitted principles of art. On this account, we have no
  reason to complain of the lectures of Fuseli, which we now purpose to
  notice. Bold and original as the writer is, we find him every where
  impressed with a respect for Reynolds, and with a conviction of the
  truth of the principles which he had collected and established. If
  there be any difference, it is occasionally on the more debatable
  ground&#8212;particular passages of criticism.</p>

  <p>In the &quot;Introduction,&quot; the student is supplied with a
  list of the authorities he should consult for the &quot;History and
  Progress of his Art.&quot; He avoids expatiating on the books purely
  elementary&#8212;&quot;the van of which is led by Leonardo da Vinci
  and Albert <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg
  692]</a></span> Durer, and the rear by Gherard Lavresse&#8212;as the
  principles which they detail must be supposed to be already in the
  student&#39;s possession, or are occasionally interwoven with the
  topics of the lectures;&quot; and proceeds &quot;to the historically
  critical writers, who consist of all the ancients yet remaining,
  Pausanias excepted.&quot; Fortunately, there remain a sufficient
  number of the monuments of ancient art &quot;to furnish us with their
  standard of style;&quot; for the accounts are so contradictory, that
  we should have little to rely upon. The works of the ancient artists
  are all lost: we must be content with the &quot;hasty compilations of
  a warrior,&quot; Pliny, or the &quot;incidental remarks of an
  orator,&quot; (rhetorician,) Quintilian. The former chiefly valuable
  when he quotes&#8212;for then, as Reynolds observed, &quot;he speaks
  the language of an artist:&quot; as in his account of the glazing
  method of Apelles; the manner in which Protogenes embodied his
  colours; and the term of art <i>circumlitio</i>, by which Nicias gave
  &quot;the line of correctness to the models of Praxiteles;&quot; the
  foreshortening the bull by Pausias, and throwing his shade on the
  crowd&#8212;showing a forcible chiaroscuro. &quot;Of Quintilian,
  whose information is all relative to style, the tenth chapter of the
  XII.th book, a passage on expression in the XI.th, and scattered
  fragments of observations analogous to the process of his own art, is
  all that we possess; but what he says, though comparatively small in
  bulk, with what we have of Pliny, leaves us to wish for more. His
  review of the revolutions of style in painting, from Polygnotus to
  Apelles, and in sculpture, from Phidias to Lysippus, is succinct and
  rapid; but though so rapid and succinct, every word is poised by
  characteristic precision, and can only be the result of long and
  judicious enquiry, and perhaps even minute examination.&quot; Still
  less have we scattered in the writings of Cicero, who, &quot;though
  he seems to have had little native taste for painting and sculpture,
  and even less than he had taste for poetry, had a conception of
  nature; and with his usual acumen, comparing the principles of one
  art with those of another, frequently scattered useful hints, or made
  pertinent observations. For many of these he might probably be
  indebted to Hortensius, with whom, though his rival in eloquence, he
  lived on terms of familiarity, and who was a man of declared taste,
  and one of the first collectors of the time.&quot; He speaks somewhat
  too slightingly of Pausanias,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
  "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
  as &quot;the indiscriminate chronicler of legitimate tradition and
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg
  693]</a></span> legendary trash,&quot; considering that he praises
  &quot;the scrupulous diligence with which he examined what fell under
  his own eye.&quot; He recommends to the epic or dramatic artist the
  study of the heroics of the elder, and the Eicones or Picture
  Galleries of the elder and younger Philostratus.</p>

  <p>&quot;The innumerable hints, maxims, anecdotes, descriptions,
  scattered over Lucian, &#338;lian, AthenÃ¦us, Achilles Tatius, Tatian
  Pollux, and many more, may be consulted to advantage by the man of
  taste and letters, and probably may be neglected without much loss by
  the student.&quot; &quot;Of modern writers on art Vasari leads the
  van; theorist, artist, critic, and biographer, in one. The history of
  modern art owes, no doubt, much to Vasari; he leads us from its
  cradle to its maturity with the anxious diligence of a nurse; but he
  likewise has her derelictions: for more loquacious than ample, and
  less discriminating styles than eager to accumulate descriptions, he
  is at an early period exhausted by the superlatives lavished on
  inferior claims, and forced into frigid rhapsodies and astrologic
  nonsense to do justice to the greater. He swears by the divinity of
  M. Agnolo. He tells us that he copied every figure of the Capella
  Sistina and the stanze of Raffaelle, yet his memory was either so
  treacherous, or his rapidity in writing so inconsiderate, that his
  account of both is a mere heap of errors and unpardonable confusion,
  and one might almost fancy he had never entered the Vatican.&quot; He
  is less pleased with the &quot;rubbish of his contemporaries, or
  followers, from Condior to Ridolfi, and on to Malvasia.&quot; All is
  little worth &quot;till the appearance of Lanzi, who, in his
  &#39;Storia Pittorica della Italia,&#39; has availed himself of all
  the information existing in his time, has corrected most of those who
  wrote before him, and, though perhaps not possessed of great
  discriminative powers, has accumulated more instructive anecdotes,
  rescued more deserving names from oblivion, and opened a wider
  prospect of art, than all his predecessors.&quot; But for the
  valuable notes of Reynolds, the idle pursuit of Du Fresnoy to clothe
  the precepts of art in Latin verse, would be useless. &quot;The notes
  of Reynolds, treasures of practical observation, place him among
  those whom we may read with profit.&quot; De Piles and Felibien are
  spoken of next, as the teachers of &quot;what may be learned from
  precept, founded on prescriptive authority more than on the verdicts
  of nature.&quot; Of the effects of the system pursued by the French
  Academy from such precepts, our author is, perhaps, not undeservedly
  severe.</p>

  <p>&quot;About the middle of the last century the German critics,
  established at Rome, began to claim the exclusive privilege of
  teaching the art, and to form a complete system of antique style. The
  verdicts of Mengs and Winkelmann, become the oracles of antiquaries,
  dilettanti, and artists, from the Pyrenees to the utmost north of
  Europe, have been detailed, and are not without their influence here.
  Winkelmann was the parasite of the fragments that fell from the
  conversation or the tablets of Mengs&#8212;a deep scholar, and better
  fitted to comment on a classic than to give lessons on art and style,
  he reasoned himself into frigid reveries and Platonic dreams on
  beauty. As far as the taste or the instruction of his tutor directed,
  he is right when they are; and between his own learning and the
  tuition of the other, his history of art delivers a specious system,
  and a prodigious number of useful observations.&quot; &quot;To him
  Germany owes the shackles of her artists, and the narrow limits of
  their aim.&quot; Had Fuseli lived to have witnessed the
  &quot;revival&quot; at Munich, he would have appreciated the efforts
  made, and still making, there. He speaks of the works of Mengs with
  respect. &quot;The works of Mengs himself are, no doubt, full of the
  most useful information, deep observation, and often consummate
  criticism. He has traced and distinguished the principles of the
  moderns from those of the ancients; and in his comparative view of
  the design, colour, composition, and expression of Raffaelle,
  Correggio, and Tiziano, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_694"
  id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span> luminous perspicuity and deep
  precision, pointed out the prerogative or inferiority of each. As an
  artist, he is an instance of what perseverance, study, experience,
  and encouragement can achieve to supply the place of genius.&quot; He
  then, passing by all English critics preceding Reynolds, with the
  petty remark, that &quot;the last is undoubtedly the first,&quot;
  says&#8212;&quot;To compare Reynolds with his predecessors, would
  equally disgrace our judgment, and impeach our gratitude. His volumes
  can never be consulted without profit, and should never be quitted by
  the student&#39;s hand but to embody, by exercise, the precepts he
  gives and the means he points out.&quot; It is useful thus to see
  together the authorities which a student should consult, and we have
  purposely characterized them as concisely as we could, in our
  extracts, which strongly show the peculiar style of Mr Fuseli. If
  this introduction was, however, intended for artists, it implies in
  them a more advanced education in Greek and Latin literature than
  they generally possess. Mr Fuseli was himself an accomplished
  scholar. How desirable is it that the arts and general scholarship
  should go together! The classics, fully to be enjoyed, require no
  small cultivation in art; and as the greater portion of ancient art
  is drawn from that source, Greek mythology, and classical history and
  literature, such an education would seem to be the very first step in
  the acquirements of an artist. We believe that in general they
  content themselves with Lempriere&#39;s Dictionary; and that rather
  for information on subjects they may see already painted, than for
  their own use; and thus, for lack of a feeling which only education
  can give, a large field of resources is cut off from them. If it be
  said that English literature&#8212;English classics, will supply the
  place, we deny it; for there is not an English classic of value to an
  artist, who was not, to his very heart&#39;s core, embued with a
  knowledge and love of the ancient literature. We might instance but
  two, Spenser and Milton&#8212;the statute-books of the better English
  art&#8212;authors whom, we do not hesitate to say, no one can
  thoroughly understand or enjoy, who has not far advanced in classical
  education. We shall never cease to throw out remarks of this kind,
  with the hope that our universities will yet find room to foster the
  art within them; satisfied as we are that the advantages would be
  immense, both to the art and to the universities. How many would then
  pursue pleasures and studies most congenial with their usual
  academical education, and, thus occupied, be rescued from pursuits
  that too often lead to profligacy and ruin; and sacrifice to
  pleasures that cannot last, those which, where once fostered, have
  ever been permanent!</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p><a name="FIRST_LECTURE" id="FIRST_LECTURE"></a>The <span class=
  'smcap'>First Lecture</span> is a summary of ancient art&#8212;one
  rather of research than interest&#8212;more calculated to excite the
  curiosity of the student than to offer him any profitable
  instruction. The general matter is well known to most, who have at
  all studied the subject. Nor have we sufficient confidence in any
  theory as to the rise and growth of art in Greece, to lay much stress
  upon those laid down in this lecture. We doubt if the religion of
  Greece ever had that hold upon the feelings of the people, artists,
  or their patrons, which is implied in the supposition, that it was an
  efficient cause. A people that could listen to the broad farce of
  Aristophanes, and witness every sort of contempt thrown upon the
  deities they professed to worship, were not likely to seek in
  religion the advancement of art; and their licentious
  liberty&#8212;if liberty it deserved to be called&#8212;was of too
  watchful a jealousy over greatness of every kind, to suffer genius to
  be free and without suspicion. We will not follow the lecturer
  through his conjectures on the mechanic processes. It is more curious
  than useful to trace back the more perfect art through its
  stages&#8212;the &quot;Polychrom,&quot; the &quot;Monochrom,&quot;
  the &quot;Monogram,&quot; and &quot;Skiagram&quot;&#8212;nor from the
  pencil to the &quot;cestrum.&quot; Polygnotus is said to be the first
  who introduced the &quot;essential style;&quot; which consisted in
  ascertaining the abstract, the general form, as it is technically
  termed the central form. Art under Polygnotus was, however, in a
  state of formal &quot;parallelism;&quot; certainly it could boast no
  variety of composition. Apollodorus &quot;applied the essential
  principles of Polygnotus to the delineation of the species, by
  investigating the leading forms that discriminate the various classes
  of human qualities and passions.&quot; He saw that all men were
  connected together by one general form, yet were separated by some
  predominant power into classes; &quot;thence he drew his line of
  imitation, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id=
  "Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span> personified the central form of the
  class to which his object belonged, and to which the rest of its
  qualities administered, without being absorbed.&quot; Zeuxis, from
  the essential of Polygnotus and specific discrimination of
  Apollodorus, comparing one with the other, formed his ideal style.
  Thus are there the three styles&#8212;the essential, the
  characteristic, the ideal.</p>

  <p>Art was advanced and established under Parrhasius and Timanthes,
  and refined under Eupompus, Apelles, Aristides, and Euphranor.
  &quot;The correctness of Parrhasius succeeded to the genius of
  Zeuxis. He circumscribed the ample style, and by subtle examination
  of outline, established that standard of divine and heroic form which
  raised him to the authority of a legislator, from whose decisions
  there was no appeal. He gave to the divine and heroic character in
  painting, what Polycletus had given to the human in sculpture by his
  Doryphorus, a canon of proportion. Phidias had discovered in the nod
  of the Homeric Jupiter the characteristic of majesty, <i>inclination
  of the head</i>. This hinted to him a higher elevation of the neck
  behind, a bolder protrusion of the front, and the increased
  perpendicular of the profile. To this conception Parrhasius fixed a
  maximum; that point from which descends the ultimate line of
  celestial beauty, the angle within which moves what is inferior,
  beyond which what is portentous. From the head conclude to the
  proportions of the neck, the limbs, the extremities; from the Father
  to the race of gods; all, the sons of one, Zeus; derived from one
  source of tradition, Homer; formed by one artist, Phidias; on him
  measured and decided by Parrhasius. In the simplicity of this
  principle, adhered to by the succeeding periods, lies the
  uninterrupted progress and the unattainable superiority of Grecian
  art.&quot;</p>

  <p>In speaking of Timanthes as the competitor with Parrhasius, as one
  who brought into the art more play of the mind and passions, the
  lecturer takes occasion to discuss the often discussed and disputed
  propriety of Timanthes, in covering the head of Agamemnon in his
  picture of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. He thinks it the more
  incumbent on him so to do, as the &quot;late president&quot; had
  passed a censure upon Timanthes. Sir Joshua expressed his
  <i>doubt</i> only, not his censure absolutely, upon the delivery of
  the prize at the Academy for the best picture painted from this
  subject. He certainly dissents from bestowing the praise, upon the
  supposition of the intention being the avoiding a difficulty. And as
  to this point, the well-known authorities of Cicero, Quintilian,
  Valerius Maximus, and Pliny, seem to agree. And <i>if</i>, as the
  lecturer observes in a note, the painter is made to waste expression
  on inferior actors at the expense of a principal one, he is an
  improvident spendthrift, not a wise economist. The pertness of
  Falconet is unworthy grave criticism and the subject, though it is
  quoted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He assumes that Agamemnon is the
  principal figure. Undoubtedly Mr Fuseli is right&#8212;Iphigenia is
  the principal figure; and it may be fairly admitted, that the
  overpowering expression of the grief of the father would have divided
  the subject. It might be more properly a separate picture. Art is
  limited; nothing should detract from the principal figure, the
  principal action&#8212;passion. Our sympathy is not called for on
  behalf of the father here: the grief of the others in the picture is
  the grief in perfect sympathy with Iphigenia; the father would have
  been absorbed in his own grief, and his grief would have been an
  unsympathetic grief towards Iphigenia. It was his own case that he
  felt; and it does appear to us an aggravation of the suffering of
  Iphigenia, that, at the moment of her sacrifice, she saw indeed her
  father&#39;s person, but was never more&#8212;and knew she was never
  more&#8212;to behold his face again. This circumstance alone would
  justify Timanthes, but other concurrent reasons may be given. It was
  no want of power to express the father&#39;s grief, for it is in the
  province of art to express every such delineation; but there
  <i>is</i> a point of grief that is ill expressed by the countenance
  at all; and there is a natural action in such cases for the sufferer
  himself to hide his face, as if conscious that it was not in
  agreement with his feelings. Such grief is astounding: we look for
  the expression of it, and find it not: it is better than receive this
  shock to hide the face. We do it naturally; so that here the art of
  the painter, that required that his picture should be a whole, and
  centre in Iphigenia, was mainly assisted by the proper adoption of
  this natural action of Agamemnon. Mr Fuseli, whose criticism
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg
  696]</a></span> is always acute, and generally just and true, has
  well discussed the subject, and properly commented upon the flippancy
  of Falconet. After showing the many ways in which the painter might
  have expressed the parent&#39;s grief, and that none of them would be
  <i>decere, pro dignitate, digne</i>, he adds&#8212;&#39;But Timanthes
  had too true a sense of nature to expose a father&#39;s feelings, or
  to tear a passion to rags; nor had the Greeks yet learned of Rome to
  steel the face. If he made Agamemnon bear his calamity as a man, he
  made him also feel it as a man. It became the leader of Greece to
  sanction the ceremony with his presence: it did not become the father
  to see his daughter beneath the dagger&#39;s point: the same nature
  that threw a real mantle over the face of Timoleon, when he assisted
  at the punishment of his brother, taught Timanthes to throw an
  imaginary one over the face of Agamemnon; neither height nor depth,
  <i>propriety</i> of expression was his aim.&#39; It is a question
  whether Timanthes took the idea from the text of Euripides, or
  whether it is his invention, and was borrowed by the dramatist. The
  picture must have presented a contrast to that of his rival
  Parrhasius, which exhibited the fury of Ajax.</p>

  <p>Whether the invention was or was not the merit of Euripides,
  certainly this is not the only instance wherein he has turned it to
  dramatic advantage. No dramatist was so distinct a painter as
  Euripides; his mind was ever upon picture. He makes Hecuba, in the
  dialogue with Agamemnon, say, &quot;Pity me, and, standing apart as
  would a painter, look at me, and see what evils I have,&quot;</p>

  <p>But in the instance in question, in the Iphigenia, there is one
  circumstance that seems to have been overlooked by the critics, which
  makes the action of Agamemnon the more expressive, and gives it a
  peculiar force: the dramatist takes care to exhibit the more than
  common parental and filial love; when asked by Clytemnestra what
  would be her last, her dying request, it is instantly, on her
  father&#39;s account, to avert every feeling of wrath against
  him:&#8212;</p>

  </div>

  <p>And even when the father covers his face, she is close beside him,
  <i>tells him that she is beside him</i>, and her last words are to
  comfort him. Now, whether Timanthes took the scene from Euripides or
  Euripides from Timanthes, it could not be more powerfully, more
  naturally conceived; for this dramatic incident, the tender movement
  to his side, and speech of Iphigenia, could not have been imagined,
  or at least with little effect, had not the father first covered his
  face. Mr Fuseli has collected several instances of attempts something
  similar in pictures, particularly by Massaccio, and Raffaelle from
  him; and he well remarks&#8212;&quot;We must conclude that Nature
  herself dictated to him this method, as superior to all he could
  express by features; and that he recognized the same dictate in
  Massaccio, who can no more be supposed to have been acquainted with
  the precedent of Timanthes than Shakspeare with that of Euripides,
  when he made Macduff draw his hat over his face.&quot; From Timanthes
  Mr Fuseli proceeds to eulogize Aristides; whom history records as, in
  a peculiar excellence, the painter of the passions of nature.
  &quot;Such, history informs us, was the suppliant whose voice you
  seemed to hear, such his sick man&#39;s half-extinguished eye and
  labouring breast, such Byblis expiring in the pangs of love, and,
  above all, the half-slain mother shuddering lest the eager babe
  should suck the blood from her palsied
  nipple.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Timanthes had marked the limits that
  discriminate terror from the excess of horror; Aristides drew the
  line that separates it from disgust.&quot; Then follows a very just
  criticism upon instances in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_697"
  id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span> which he considered that Raffaelle
  himself and Nicolo Poussin had overstepped the bounds of propriety,
  and averted the feelings from their object, by ideas of disgust. In
  the group of Raffaelle, a man is removing the child from the breast
  of the mother with one hand, while the other is applied to his
  nostrils. Poussin, in his plague of the Philistines, has copied the
  loathsome action&#8212;so, likewise, in another picture, said to be
  the plague of Athens, but without much reason so named, in the
  collection of J. P. Mills, Esq. Dr Waagen, in his admiration for the
  executive part of art, speaks of it as &quot;a very rich masterpiece
  of Poussin, in which we are reconciled by his skill to the horrors of
  the subject.&quot;</p>

  <p>In the commencement of the lecture, there are offered some
  definitions of the terms of art, &quot;nature, grace, taste, copy,
  imitation, genius, talent.&quot; In that of nature, he seems entirely
  to agree with Reynolds; that of beauty leaves us pretty much in the
  dark in our search for it, &quot;as that harmonious whole of the
  human frame, that unison of parts to one end, which enchants us. The
  result of the standard set by the great masters of our art, the
  ancients, and confirmed by the submissive verdict of modern
  imitation.&quot; This is unphilosophical, unsatisfactory; nor is that
  of grace less so&#8212;&quot;that artless balance of motion and
  repose, sprung from character, founded on propriety, which neither
  falls short of the demands, nor overleaps the modesty of nature.
  Applied to execution it means that dexterous power which hides the
  means by which it was attained, the difficulties it has
  conquered.&quot; We humbly suggest, that both parts of this
  definition may be found where there is little grace. It is evident
  that the lecturer did not subscribe to any theory of lines, as <i>per
  se</i> beautiful or graceful, and altogether disregarded
  Hogarth&#39;s line of beauty. Had Mr Hay&#39;s very admirable short
  works&#8212;his &quot;Theory of Form and
  Proportion&quot;&#8212;appeared in Mr Fuseli&#39;s day, he would have
  taken a new view of beauty and grace. By taste, he means not only a
  knowledge of what is right in art, but a power to estimate degrees of
  excellence, &quot;and by comparison proceeds from justness to
  refinement.&quot; This, too, we think inadequate to express what we
  mean by taste, which appears to us to have something of a sense,
  independent of knowledge. Using words in a technical sense, we may
  define them to mean what we please, but certainly the words
  themselves, &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;imitation,&quot; do not mean
  very different things. He thinks &quot;precision of eye, and
  obedience of hand, are the requisites for copy, without the least
  pretence to choice, what to select, what to reject; whilst choice,
  directed by judgment or taste, constitutes the essence of imitation,
  and alone can raise the most dexterous copyist to the noble rank of
  an artist.&quot; We do not exactly see how this judgment arises out
  of his definition of &quot;taste.&quot; But it may be fair to follow
  him still closer on this point. &quot;The imitation of the ancients
  was, <i>essential</i>, <i>characteristic</i>, <i>ideal</i>. The first
  cleared nature of accident, defect, excrescence, (which was in fact
  his definition of nature, as so cleared;) the second found the
  <i>stamen</i> which connects character with the central form; the
  third raised the whole and the parts to the highest degree of
  unison.&quot; This is rather loose writing, and not very close
  reasoning. After all, it may be safer to take words in their common
  acceptation; for it is very difficult in a treatise of any length, to
  preserve in the mind or memory the precise ideas of given
  definitions. &quot;Of genius, I shall speak with reserve; for no word
  has been more indiscriminately confounded. By genius, I mean that
  power which enlarges the circle of human knowledge, which discovers
  new materials of nature, or combines the known with novelty; whilst
  talent arranges, cultivates, polishes the discoveries of
  genius.&quot; Definitions, divisions, and subdivisions, though
  intended to make clear, too often entangle the ground unnecessarily,
  and keep the mind upon the stretch to remember, when it should only
  feel. We think this a fault with Mr Fuseli; it often renders him
  obscure, and involves his style of aphorisms in the mystery of a
  riddle.</p>

  <p><a name="SECOND_LECTURE" id="SECOND_LECTURE"></a><span class=
  'smcap'>Second Lecture</span>.&#8212;This lecture comprises a
  compendious history of modern art; commencing with Massaccio. If
  religion gave the impulse to both ancient and modern, so has it
  stamped each with the different characters itself assumed. The
  conceptions the ancients had of divinity, were the perfection of the
  human form; thus form and beauty became godlike. The Christian
  religion wore a more spiritual character. In ancient <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span> art,
  human form and beauty were triumphant; in modern art, the greater
  triumph was in humility, in suffering; the religious inspiration was
  to be shown in its influence in actions less calculated to display
  the powers, the energies of form, than those of mind. Mere external
  beauty had its accompanying vices; and it was compelled to lower its
  pretensions considerably, submit to correction, and take a more
  subordinate part. Thus, if art lost in form it gained in expression,
  and thus was really more divine. Art in its revival, passing through
  the barbarity of Gothic adventurers, not unencumbered with senseless
  superstitions, yet with wondrous rapidity, raised itself to the
  noblest conceptions of both purity and magnificence. Sculpture had,
  indeed, preceded painting in the works of Ghiberti Donato and
  Philippo Brunelleschi, when Massaccio appeared. &quot;He first
  perceived that parts are to constitute a whole; that composition
  ought to have a centre; expression, truth; and execution, unity. His
  line deserves attention, though his subjects led him not to
  investigation of form, and the shortness of his life forbade his
  extending those elements, which Raffaelle, nearly a century
  afterwards, carried to perfection.&quot; That great master of
  expression did not disdain to borrow from him&#8212;as is seen in the
  figure of &quot;St Paul preaching at Athens,&quot; and that of
  &quot;Adam expelled from Paradise.&quot; Andrea Mantegna attempted to
  improve upon Massaccio, by adding form from study of the antique. Mr
  Fuseli considers his &quot;taste too crude, his fancy too grotesque,
  and his comprehension too weak, to advert from the parts that
  remained to the whole that inspired them; hence, in his figures of
  dignity or beauty, we see not only the meagre forms of common models,
  but even their defects tacked to ideal torsos.&quot; We think,
  however, he is deserving of more praise than the lecturer was
  disposed to bestow upon him, and that his &quot;triumphs,&quot; the
  processions, (at Hampton Court,) are not quite justly called &quot;a
  copious inventory of classic lumber, swept together with more
  industry than taste, but full of valuable materials.&quot; Yet when
  it is said, that he was &quot;not ignorant of expression,&quot; and
  that &quot;his Burial of Christ furnished Raffaelle with composition,
  and even &quot;some figures and attitudes,&quot; the severity of the
  opinion seems somewhat mitigated. Luca Signorelli, more indebted to
  nature than the study of the antique, &quot;seems to have been the
  first who contemplated with a discriminating eye his object; saw what
  was accidental, and what essential; balanced light and shade, and
  decided the motion of his figures. He foreshortened with equal
  boldness and intelligence.&quot; It was thought by Vasari, that in
  his &quot;Judgment,&quot; Michael Angelo had imitated him. At this
  period of the &quot;dawn of modern art, Leonardo da Vinci broke forth
  with a splendour which distanced former excellence; made up of all
  the elements that constitute the essence of genius; favoured by
  education and circumstances&#8212;all ear, all eye, all grasp;
  painter, poet, sculptor, anatomist, architect, engineer, chemist,
  machinist, musician, man of science, and sometimes empiric, he laid
  hold of every beauty in the enchanted circle, but without exclusive
  attachment to one, dismissed in her turn each.&quot; &quot;We owe him
  chiaroscuro, with all its magic&#8212;we owe him caricature, with all
  its incongruities.&quot; His genius was shown in the design of the
  cartoon intended for the council-chamber at Florence, which he
  capriciously abandoned, wherein the group of horsemen might fairly
  rival the greatness of Michael Angelo himself; and in the well-known
  &quot;Last Supper,&quot; in the refectory of the Dominicans at Milan,
  best known, however, from the copies which remain of it, and the
  studies which remain. Fra Bartolomeo, &quot;the last master of this
  period, first gave gradation to colour, form and masses to drapery,
  and a grave dignity, till then unknown, to execution.&quot; His was
  the merit of having weaned Raffaelle &quot;from the meanness of
  Pietro Perugino, and prepared for the mighty style of Michael Angelo
  Buonarotti.&quot; Mr Fuseli is inspired by his admiration of that
  wonderful man, as painter, sculptor, and architect.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sublimity of conception, grandeur of form, and breadth of
  manner, are the elements of Michael Angelo&#39;s style. By these
  principles, he selected or rejected the objects of imitation. As
  painter, as sculptor, as architect, he attempted&#8212;and above any
  other man, succeeded&#8212;to unite magnificence of plan, and endless
  variety of subordinate parts, with the utmost simplicity and breadth.
  His line is uniformly grand. Character and beauty were <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>
  admitted only as far as they could be made subservient to grandeur.
  The child, the female, meanness, deformity, were by him
  indiscriminately stamped with grandeur. A beggar rose from his hand
  the patriarch of poverty; the hump of his dwarf is impressed with
  dignity; his women are moulds of generation, his infants teem with
  man; his men are a race of giants. This is the &#39;terribile
  via&#39; hinted at by Agostino Caracci; though, perhaps, as little
  understood by the Bolognese as by the blindest of his Tuscan adorers,
  with Vasari at their head. To give the appearance of perfect ease to
  the most perplexing difficulty, was the exclusive power of Michael
  Angelo. He is the inventor of epic in painting, in that sublime
  circle of the Sistine chapel which exhibits the origin, the progress,
  and the final dispensations of theocracy. He has personated motion in
  the groups of the cartoon of Pisa; embodied sentiment on the
  monuments of St Lorenzo; unraveled the features of meditation in the
  prophets and sibyls of the Sistine chapel; and in the &#39;Last
  Judgment,&#39; with every attitude that varies the human body, traced
  the master trait of every passion that sways the human heart. Though,
  as sculptor, he expressed the character of flesh more perfectly than
  all who went before or came after him, yet he never submitted to copy
  an individual&#8212;Julio the Second only excepted; and in him he
  represented the reigning passion rather than the man. In painting, he
  contented himself with a negative colour, and as the painter of
  mankind, rejected all meretricious ornament. The fabric of St
  Peter&#39;s scattered into infinity of jarring parts by Bramante and
  his successors, he concentrated; suspended the cupola, and to the
  most complex, gave the air of the most simple of edifices. Such, take
  him for all in all, was Michael Angelo, the salt of art; sometimes,
  no doubt, he had his moments of dereliction, deviated into manner, or
  perplexed the grandeur of his forms with futile and ostentatious
  anatomy; both met with armies of copyists, and it has been his fate
  to have been censured for their folly.&quot; This studied panegyric
  is nevertheless vigorous&#8212;emulous as that of Longinus, of
  showing the author to be&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Himself, the great sublime he draws.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>It hurries away the mind of the reader till it kindles a congenial
  enthusiasm, we have the more readily given the quotation, as it is
  not an unfair specimen of Mr Fuseli&#39;s power, both of thought and
  language. Our author is scarcely less eloquent in his eulogy of
  Raffaelle which follows. He has seized on the points of character of
  that great painter very happily. &quot;His composition always hastens
  to the most necessary point as its centre, and from that
  disseminates, to that leads back, as rays, all secondary ones. Group,
  form, and contrast are subordinate to the event, and common-place
  ever excluded. His expression, in strict unison with, and inspired by
  character; whether calm, agitated, convulsed, or absorbed by the
  inspiring passion, unmixed and pure, never contradicts its cause,
  equally remote from tameness and grimace: the moment of his choice
  never suffers the action to stagnate or expire; it is the moment of
  transition, the crisis, big with the past, and pregnant with the
  future.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is certainly true&#8212;the moment generally chosen by
  Raffaelle, is not of the action completed, the end&#8212;but that in
  which it is doing. You instantly acknowledge the power, while your
  curiosity is not quenched. For instance, in the cartoon of the
  &quot;Beautiful Gate,&quot; you see the action at the word is just
  breaking into the miracle&#8212;the cripple is yet in his distorted
  infirmity&#8212;but you see near him grace and activity of limb
  beautifully displayed, in that mother and running child; and you look
  to the perfection which, you feel sure, the miracle will complete.
  This is by no means the best instance&#8212;it is the case in all his
  compositions where a story is to be told. It is this action which,
  united with most perfect character and expression, makes the life of
  Raffaelle&#39;s pictures. We think, however, that even in so summary
  a history of art as this, the object of which seems to be to mark the
  steps to its perfection, the influence of Pietro Perugino should not
  have been omitted. He is often very pure in sentiment, often more
  than bordering on grace, and in colour perhaps superior to Raffaelle.
  Notwithstanding Mr Fuseli&#39;s eulogy of Raffaelle, we doubt if he
  fully entered into his highest sentiment. This we may show when we
  comment on another lecture. While Rome and Tuscany were thus
  fostering the higher principles of art, the fascination <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span> of
  colour was spreading a new charm to every eye at Venice, from the
  pencils of Giorgione, and of Titian. Had not Titian been a colourist,
  his genius was not unequal to the great style; perhaps he has
  admitted of that style as much as would suit the predominant
  character of his colouring. He worked less with chiaroscuro than
  colour, which he endowed with all the sentiment of his subject. Mr
  Fuseli considers landscape to have originated with Titian.</p>

  <p>&quot;Landscape, whether it be considered as the transcript of a
  spot, or the rich combination of congenial objects, or as the scene
  of a phenomenon, dates its origin from him:&quot; so of portrait, he
  says&#8212;&quot;He is the father of portrait painting, of
  resemblance with form, character with dignity, and costume with
  subordination.&quot; The yet wanting charm of art&#8212;perfect
  harmony, was reserved for Correggio. &quot;The harmony and grace of
  Correggio are proverbial; the medium which, by breadth of gradation,
  unites two opposite principles, the coalition of light and darkness,
  by imperceptible transition, are the element of his style.&quot;
  &quot;This unison of a whole predominates in all that remains of him,
  from the vastness of his cupolas to the smallest of his oil pictures.
  The harmony of Correggio, though assisted by exquisite hues, was
  entirely independent of colour; his great organ was chiaroscuro in
  its most extensive sense&#8212;compared with the expanse in which he
  floats, the effects of Leonardi da Vinci are little more than the
  dying ray of evening, and the concentrated flash of Giorgione
  discordant abruptness. The bland, central light of a globe,
  imperceptibly gliding through lucid demi-tints into rich reflected
  shades, composes the spell of Correggio, and affects us with the soft
  emotions of a delicious dream.&quot; Here terminates the great, the
  primal era. Such were the patriarchs of modern art. Here, it may be
  said, terminated the great discoverers. Mr Fuseli pauses here to
  observe, that we should consider the characteristic of each of these
  painters, not their occasional deviations; for not unfrequently did
  Titian rise to the loftiness of conception of Michael Angelo, and
  Correggio occasionally &quot;exceeded all competition in expression
  in the divine features of his <i>Ecce Homo</i>.&quot; If Mr Fuseli
  alludes to the <i>Ecce Homo</i> now in our National Gallery, we
  cannot go along with him in this praise&#8212;but in that picture,
  the expression of the true &quot;Mater dolorosa&quot; was never
  equaled. Art now proceeds to its period of &quot;Refinement.&quot;
  The great schools&#8212;the Tuscan, the Roman, the Venetian, and the
  Lombard&#8212;from whatever cause, separated. Michael Angelo lived to
  see his great style polluted by Tuscan and Venetian, &quot;as the
  ostentatious vehicle of puny conceits and emblematic quibbles, or the
  palliative of empty pomp and degraded luxuriance of colour.&quot; He
  considers Andrea del Sarto to have been his copyer, not his imitator.
  Tibaldi seems to have caught somewhat of his mind. As did Sir Joshua,
  so does Mr Fuseli mention his Polypheme groping at the mouth of his
  cave for Ulysses. He expresses his surprise that Michael Angelo was
  unacquainted with the great talent of Tibaldi, but lavished his
  assistance on inferior men, Sebastian del Piombo and Daniel of
  Volterra. We think he does not do fair justice to the merits of these
  undoubtedly great men. We shall have occasion hereafter to notice his
  criticism on the great work of Sebastian, in our National Gallery. We
  are surprised that he should consider Sebastian del Piombo deficient
  in ideal colour, and that the lines of Daniel of Volterra are meagre
  and sterile of idea&#8212;his celebrated Descent from the Cross being
  in its lines, as tending to perfect the composition, and to make full
  his great idea, quite extraordinary. Poor Vasari, who can never find
  favour with our author, is considered the great depravator of the
  style of Michael Angelo.</p>

  <p>At the too early death of Raffaelle, his style fell into gradual
  decay. Still Julio Romano, and Polidoro da Carravaggio,
  &quot;deserted indeed the standard of their master, but with a
  dignity and magnitude of compass which command respect.&quot;</p>

  <p>The taste of Julio Romano was not pure enough to detach him from
  &quot;deformity and grimace&quot; and &quot;ungenial colour.&quot;
  Primaticcio and Nicolo dell Abate propagated the style of Julio
  Romano on the Gallic side of the Alps, in mythologic and allegoric
  works. These frescoes from the Odyssea at Fontainbleau are lost, but
  are worthy admiration, though in the feeble etchings of Theodore van
  Fulden. The &quot;ideal light and shade, and tremendous breadth of
  manner&quot; of Michael <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_701" id=
  "Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span> Angelo Amerigi, surnamed Il Caravaggi,
  are next commended. &quot;The aim and style of the Roman school
  deserve little further notice here, till the appearance of Nicolo
  Poussin.&quot; His partiality for the antique mainly affected his
  style. &quot;He has left specimens to show that he was sometimes
  sublime, and often in the highest degree pathetic.&quot; Mr Fuseli
  takes occasion, by contrasting &quot;the classic regularity&quot; of
  Poussin with the &quot;wildness of Salvator Rosa&quot;&#8212;we think
  unnecessarily, because there seems to be no true point of comparison,
  and unjustly to censure that great, we may say, that original
  painter. We have noticed occasionally a capricious dislike in our
  author to some artists, for which we are at a loss to account. That
  Salvator should &quot;hide by boldness of hand his inability of
  exhibiting her (Nature) impassioned,&quot; is a sentence that will
  scarcely meet with an assenting critic. The wealth and luxury of
  Venice soon demanded of art, to sacrifice the modesty of nature to
  ostentation. The principle of Titian was, however, followed by
  Tintoretto, Bassan, Paul Veronese, and then passed to Velasquez the
  Spaniard, in Italy. From him &quot;Rubens and Vandyck attempted to
  transplant it to Flanders, France, and England, with unequal
  success.&quot; The style of Correggio scarcely survived him, for he
  had more imitators of parts than followers of the whole. His grace
  became elegance under the hand of Parmegiano. &quot;That disengaged
  play of delicate forms, the &#39;saltezza&#39; of the Italians, is
  the prerogative of Parmegiano, though nearly always obtained at the
  expense of proportion.&quot; We cannot agree with the lecturer, that
  the Moses of Parmegiano&#8212;if he speaks of <i>the</i> Moses
  referred to in the Discourses of Sir Joshua, of which Mr Burnet, in
  his second edition, has given a plate&#8212;loses &quot;the dignity
  of the lawgiver in the savage.&quot; Such was the state of art to the
  foundation of the Eclectic School by the Caracci&#8212;an attempt to
  unite the excellences of all schools. The principles are perpetuated
  in a sonnet by Agostino Caracci. The Caracci were, however, in their
  practice above their precepts. Theirs, too, was the school of the
  &quot;Naturalists.&quot; Ludovico is particularly praised for his
  solemnity of hue, most suited to his religious
  subjects&#8212;&quot;that sober twilight, the air of cloistered
  meditation, which you have so often heard recommended as the proper
  tone of historic colour.&quot; If the recommendation has at our
  Academy been often heard, it has entirely lost its influence; our
  English school is&#8212;with an ignorance of the real object of
  colour, or with a very bad taste as to its harmony&#8212;running into
  an opposite extravagance, destructive of real power, glaring and
  distracting where it ought to concentrate through vision the ideas of
  the mind. Annibal Caracci had more power of execution, but not the
  taste of Agostino. In their immediate scholars, the lecturer seems
  little disposed to see fairly their several excellences. They are out
  of the view of his bias. They are not Michael Angelesque. His
  judgment of Domenichino&#8212;a painter who greatly restored the
  simplicity and severity of the elder schools, and greatly surpassed
  his masters&#8212;is an instance of blindness to a power in art which
  we would almost call new, that is very strange to see.
  &quot;Domenichino, more obedient than the rest to his masters, aimed
  at the beauty of the antique, the expression of Raphael, the vigour
  of Annibal, the colour of Ludovico; and mixing something of each,
  fell short of all.&quot; Nor do we think him just with regard to
  Guercino, or even at all describing his characteristic style, when he
  speaks of his &quot;fierceness of chiaroscuro, and intrepidity of
  hand.&quot; We readily give up to him &quot;the great but abused
  talents of Pietro da Cortona,&quot; a painter without sentiment, and
  the &quot;fascinating but debauched and empty facility of Luca
  Giordano.&quot;</p>

  <p>The German schools here come under consideration, which,
  simultaneously with those of Italy, and without visible
  communication, spread the principles of art. &quot;Towards the
  decline of the fifteenth century, the uncouth essays of Martin SchÃ¶n,
  Michael Wolgemuth, and Albrecht Altorfer, were succeeded by the finer
  polish and the more dexterous method of Albert Durer.&quot; His
  well-known figure of &quot;Melancholy&quot; would alone entitle him
  to rank. The breadth and power of his wood engravings are worthy of
  admiration. Mr Fuseli thinks &quot;his colour went beyond his age,
  and as far excelled, in truth and breadth of handling, the oil-colour
  of Raphael, as Raphael excels him in every other quality.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg
  702]</a></span> His influence was not unfelt in Italy. It is visible
  in the style of even the imitators of Michael Angelo&#8212;Andrea del
  Sarto, particularly in the angular manner of his draperies. Though
  Albert Durer had no scholars, he was imitated by the Dutch Lucas of
  Leyden. Now it was that the style of Michael Angelo, spread by the
  graver of Giorgio Mantuano, brought to Italy &quot;those caravans of
  German, Dutch, and Flemish students, who, on their return from Italy,
  at the courts of Prague and Munich, in Flanders and the Netherlands,
  introduced the preposterous manner, the bloated excrescence of
  diseased brains, which, in the form of man, left nothing human;
  distorted action and gesture with insanity of affectation, and
  dressed the gewgaws of children in colossal shapes.&quot; But though
  such as Golzius, Spranger, Heyntz, and Abach, &quot;fed on the husks
  of Tuscan design, they imbibed the colour of Venice, and spread the
  elements of that excellence which distinguished the succeeding
  schools of Flanders and of Holland.&quot; So it was till the
  appearance of Rubens and Rembrandt&#8212;&quot;both of whom,
  disdaining to acknowledge the usual laws of admission to the temple
  of Fame, boldly forged their own keys, entered, and took possession,
  each of a most conspicuous place, by his own power.&quot; Rubens,
  with many advantages, acquired in his education at Antwerp, and
  already influenced by the gorgeous pomp of Austrian and Spanish
  superstition, arrived in Italy rather as the rival than pupil of the
  masters whom he travelled to study. Whatever he borrowed from the
  Venetian school&#8212;the object of his admiration&#8212;he converted
  into a new manner of florid magnificence. It is just the excellence
  of Rubens&#8212;the completeness, the congruity of his
  style&#8212;that has raised him to the eminence in the temple of fame
  which he will ever occupy. A little short of Rubens is intolerable:
  the clumsy forms and improprieties of his imitators are not to be
  endured. Mr Fuseli excepts Vandyck and Abraham Drepenbeck from the
  censure passed upon the followers of Rubens. As Drepenbeck is not so
  well known, we quote the passage respecting him:&#8212;&quot;The
  fancy of Drepenbeck, though not so exuberant, if I be not mistaken,
  excelled in sublimity the imagination of Rubens. His Bellerophon,
  Dioscuri, Hippolytus, Ixion, Sisyphus, fear no competitor among the
  productions of his master.&quot; Rembrandt he considers a genius of
  the first class in all but form. Chiaroscuro and colour were the
  elements, in fact, in which Rembrandt reveled. In these he was the
  poet&#8212;the maker. He made colour and chiaroscuro throw out ideas
  of sublimity: that he might throw himself the more into these great
  elements of his art, and depend solely on their power, he seems
  purposely not to have neglected form, but to have selected such as,
  without beauty to attract, should be merely the objects of life, the
  sensitive beings in his world of mystery. That such was his intention
  we cannot doubt; because we cannot imagine the beautiful but too
  attractive figures of the Apollo or the Venus adopted into one of his
  pictures. Excepting in a few instances, we would not wish
  Rembrandt&#39;s forms other than they are. They appear necessary to
  his style. Mr Fuseli speaks very favourably of art in Switzerland;
  but says there are only two painters of name&#8212;Holbein, and
  Francis Mola. The designs of the Passion and Dance of Death of the
  former, are instanced as works of excellence. Mola, we are surprised
  to find ranked as Swiss; for he is altogether, in art, Italian. The
  influence of the school and precepts of the Caracci, produced in
  France an abundant harvest of mediocrity. In France was the merit of
  Michael Angelo first questioned. There are, however, names that
  rescue France from the entire disgrace of the abandonment of the true
  principles of art: Nicolo Poussin, Le Sueur, Le Brun, Sebastian
  Bourdon, and Pierre Mignard. The Seven Works of Charity, by Seb.
  Bourdon, teem with surprising, pathetic, and always novel images; and
  in the Plague of David, by Pierre Mignard, our sympathy is roused by
  energies of terror and combinations of woe, which escaped Poussin and
  Raphael himself.&quot; Of Spanish art he says but little, but that
  &quot;the degree of perfection attained by Diego Velasquez, Joseph
  Ribera, and Murillo, in pursuing the same object by means as
  different as successful, impresses us with deep respect for the
  variety of their powers.&quot; Art, as every thing else, has its
  fashion. The Spanish school have, of later years, been more eagerly
  sought for; and a strange <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_703"
  id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span> whim of the day has attached a very
  extraordinary value to the works of Murillo&#8212;a painter in colour
  generally monotonous, and in form and expression almost always
  vulgar.</p>

  <p>Art in England is the next subject of the lecture. He takes a view
  of it from the age of Henry VIII. to our own. No great encouragement
  was here given to art till the time of Charles I.: Holbein, indeed,
  and Zucchero, under Elizabeth, were patronized, but &quot;were
  condemned to Gothic work and portrait painting.&quot; The troubles
  and death of Charles I. were a sad obstacle to art. &quot;His son, in
  possession of the Cartoons of Raphael, and with the magnificence of
  Whitehall before his eyes, suffered Verio to contaminate the walls of
  his palaces, or degraded Lely to paint the Cymons and Iphigenias of
  his court; whilst the manner of Kneller swept completely what might
  yet be left of taste under his successors. Such was the equally
  contemptible and deplorable state of English art, till the genius of
  Reynolds first rescued from the mannered depravation of foreigners
  his own branch; and, soon extending his view to the higher
  departments of art, joined that select body of artists who addressed
  the ever open ear, ever attentive mind, of our royal founder with the
  first idea of this establishment.&quot; After this little parade of
  our artists as a body, but four are mentioned by
  name&#8212;&quot;Reynolds, Hogarth, Gainsborough, and
  Wilson.&quot;</p>

  <p>We are surprised that, in this summary history of art, no notice
  has been taken of Van Eyck, and the influence of his discovery on
  art. Nor are we less surprised that so important a branch as
  landscape painting should have been omitted; Claude and Gaspar
  Poussin not mentioned; yet, in the English school, Wilson is spoken
  of, whose sole merit rested upon his landscape. He should more
  distinctly have stated his purpose to treat only of high and
  historical art.</p>

  <p><a name="THIRD_LECTURE" id="THIRD_LECTURE"></a><span class=
  'smcap'>Third Lecture</span>.&#8212;In the commencement, there is an
  unnecessary, and rather affectedly written disquisition of the old
  question, or rather comparison between poetry and painting, from
  which nothing is to be learned; nor does it suggest any thing. Nor do
  we now-a-days want to read pages to tell us what invention is, and
  how it differs from creation&#8212;nor is it at all important in
  matters of art, that we should draw any such distinction at all. It
  is far better to go at once &quot;in medias res,&quot; and take it
  for granted that the reader both knows and feels, without
  metaphysical discussion, what that invention is which is required to
  make a great painter. Nor are we disposed to look upon otherwise than
  impertinent, while we are waiting for didactic rules, the being told
  that &quot;he who discovers a gold mine, is surely superior to him
  who afterwards adapts the metal for use;&quot; especially when it is
  paraded with comparisons between &quot;Colombo&quot; and
  &quot;Amerigo Vespucci,&quot; and a misplaced panegyric on Newton.
  And much of this is encumbered with language that fatigues and makes
  a plain matter obscure. There is a little affectation sometimes in Mr
  Fuseli&#39;s writing of Ciceronic <i>ambages</i>, that is really
  injurious to the good sense and just thoughts, which would without
  this display, come free, open, and with power. Some pages, too, are
  taken up with a preliminary argument&#8212;&quot;<i>whether it be
  within the artist&#39;s province or not, to find or to combine a
  subject from himself, without having recourse to tradition, or the
  stores of history and poetry</i>.&quot; We have a display of learning
  to little purpose, quotations from Latin and Greek, really
  &quot;nihil ad rem;&quot; the
  &quot;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#962;&quot; of
  the Greek, and &quot;visiones&quot; of the Romans. Who that ever saw
  even one work of Hogarth, the &quot;Marriage Ã  la Mode,&quot; would
  for a moment think the question worth a thought. &quot;The misnamed
  gladiator of Agasias,&quot; seems forced into this treatise, for the
  sole purpose of showing Mr Fuseli&#39;s reading, and after all, he
  leaves the figure as uncertain as he finds it. He <i>once</i> thought
  it might have been an Alcibiades rushing from the flames, when his
  house was fired; but is more satisfied that &quot;it might form an
  admirable Ulysses bestriding the deck of his ship to defend his
  companions from the descending fangs of Scylla, or rather, with
  indignation and anguish, seeing them already snatched up, and
  writhing in the mysterious gripe.&quot; In such fanciful humours, it
  might be made to mean any thing or any body. And we are, after all,
  quite at a loss to know whether the <i>conjecture</i> is offered as a
  specimen of &quot;<i>invention</i>.&quot; He considers the cartoon of
  Pisa &quot;the most <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_704" id=
  "Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span> striking instance, of the eminent
  place due to this <i>intuitive faculty among the principal organs of
  invention</i>&quot;&#8212;we mark these words in italics, not quite
  certain of their meaning. The work is engraved for Foster, by
  Schiavonetti; and a wonderful work it is&#8212;the work of Michael
  Angelo begun in competition with Leonardo da Vinci. The original is
  said to have been destroyed by Baccio Bandinelli; still there are the
  ancient prints and drawings which show the design, and there is a
  small copy at Holkham. Benvenuto Cellini&#8212;and could there be a
  better authority?&#8212;denies that the powers afterwards exerted in
  the Capella Sistina, arrive at half its excellence. Mr Fuseli&#39;s
  description is so good, that we give it entire. &quot;It represents
  an imaginary moment relative to the war carried on by the Florentines
  against Pisa; and exhibits a numerous group of warriors, roused from
  their bathing in the Arno, by the sudden signal of a trumpet, and
  rushing to arms. This composition may, without exaggeration, be said
  to personify with unexampled variety, that motion which Agasias and
  Theon embodied in single figures. In imagining this transient moment
  from state of relaxation to a state of energy, the ideas of motion,
  to use the bold figure of Dante, seem to have showered into the
  artist&#39;s mind. From the chief, nearly placed in the centre, who
  precedes, and whose voice accompanies the trumpet, every age of human
  agility, every attitude, every feature of alarm, haste, hurry,
  exertion, eagerness, burst into so many rays, like sparks flying from
  the hammer. Many have reached, some boldly step, some have leaped on
  the rocky shore; here two arms emerging from the water, grapple with
  the rock, there two hands cry for help, and their companions bend
  over or rush on to assist them: often imitated, but inimitable, is
  the ardent feature of the grim veteran, whose every sinew labours to
  force over the dripping limbs his clothes, whilst gnashing, he pushes
  the foot through the rending garment. He is contrasted by the slender
  elegance of a half-averted youth, who, though eagerly buckling the
  armour to his thigh, methodizes haste; another swings the high-raised
  hauberk on his shoulder; whilst one, who seems a leader, mindless of
  his dress, ready for combat, and with brandished spear, overturns a
  third, who crouched to grasp a weapon; one, naked himself, buckles on
  the mail of his companion, and he, turned toward the enemy, seems to
  stamp impatiently the ground. Experience and rage; old vigour, young
  velocity; expanded or contracted, vie in exertions of energy. Yet in
  this scene of tumult, one motive animates the whole&#8212;eagerness
  to engage, with subordination to command. This preserves the dignity
  of the action, and from a strangling rabble, changes the figures to
  men, whose legitimate contest interests our wishes.&quot; Another
  example is given&#8212;Raffaelle&#39;s &quot;Incendio del
  Borgo&quot;&#8212;a good description follows: &quot;the enraged
  elements of <i>wind</i> and fire,&quot; we do not see in the
  original, not even in the drapery of the woman with her back to us in
  the foreground. Speaking of this power of &quot;invention,&quot; he
  says&#8212;after having, as we conceive, mistaken the aim of
  Raffaelle in his Madonnas, and Holy families, which was somewhat
  beyond even the &quot;charities of father, son, and
  mother&quot;&#8212;&quot;Nor shall I follow it in its more
  contaminated descent, to those representations of local manners and
  national modifications of society, whose characteristic
  discrimination and humorous exuberance, for instance, we admire in
  Hogarth, but which, like the fleeting passions of the day, every hour
  contributes something to obliterate, which soon become unintelligible
  by time, or degenerate into caricature, the chronicle of scandal, the
  history-book of the vulgar.&quot; It seems, strangely enough, to have
  been the fashion among the, in comparison with Hogarth, puny
  academicians of that day, to underrate that great painter, that moral
  painter. We really should pity the infatuated prejudice of the man,
  who could see in the deep tragedy, the moral tragedy, &quot;Marriage
  Ã  la Mode,&quot; any <i>humorous</i> exuberance; or not understand
  that the passions set forth, and for a moral end, are not &quot;the
  fleeting passions of the day,&quot; but as permanent as human
  nature&#8212;who could see, in such series of pictures, any
  &quot;caricature,&quot; or that their object is to &quot;chronicle
  scandal.&quot; That it is the &quot;history of the vulgar,&quot; we
  dispute not. For it is drama of the vulgar as of the unvulgar&#8212;a
  deep tragedy of human nature; alas! time has not made
  &quot;<i>unintelligible</i>&quot; these <i>not</i> &quot;fleeting
  passions of the day.&quot; As <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span> long as man is man, will
  Hogarth be true to nature; and nothing in art is more strange, than
  that such opinions should emanate from an Academy, and be either
  ventured upon or received <i>ex cathedra</i>.</p>

  <p>Invention, according to Mr Fuseli, receives its subjects from
  poetry or tradition&#8212;&quot;they are <i>epic</i> or sublime,
  <i>dramatic</i> or impassioned, <i>historic</i> or circumscribed by
  truth. The first <i>astonishes</i>, the second <i>moves</i>, the
  third <i>informs</i>.&quot; We confess ourselves weary of this sort
  of classification. They only tend to hamper the writer, painter, and
  critic. It is possible for a work to admit all three, and yet
  preserve its unity. And such we believe to be the case with Homer. He
  is epic and dramatic in one, and certainly historic. It is more
  ingenious than unquestionable, that Homer&#39;s purpose was to
  &quot;impress one forcible idea of war&#8212;its origin, its
  progress, and its end.&quot; Nor will the &quot;Iliad&quot; be read
  with greater delight, by the reader&#39;s reception of such an idea.
  The drawing forth the purpose of Michael Angelo&#39;s
  design&#8212;his invention, in the series of frescoes in the Sistine
  Chapel&#8212;is more happy. That theocracy is the subject&#8212;the
  dispensations of Providence to man&#8212;the Creation&#8212;life and
  adoration in Adam and Eve, their sin, their punishment, their
  separation from God&#8212;justice and grace in the Deluge and
  covenant with Noah&#8212;prophets, sibyls, herald the
  Redeemer&#8212;and the patriarchs&#8212;the Son of Man&#8212;the
  brazen serpent&#8212;and the Fall of Haman&#8212;the giant subdued by
  the stripling in Goliah and David&#8212;and the conqueror destroyed
  by female weakness in Judith, are types of his mysterious progress,
  till Jonah pronounces him immortal. The Last Judgment, and the
  Saviour the Judge of man, complete the whole&#8212;and the Founder
  and the race are reunited. Such is the spirit of the general
  invention. &quot;The specific invention of the pictures separate, as
  each constitutes an independent whole, deserves our consideration
  next: each has its centre, from which it disseminates, to which it
  leads back all secondary points, arranged, hid, or displayed, as they
  are more or less organs of the inspiring plan; each rigorously is
  circumscribed by its generic character.&quot; The more particular
  criticism on this great work of Michael Angelo, is very good, and we
  earnestly refer the reader to it. He thinks the genius of Michael
  Angelo more generic in its aim&#8212;that of Raffaelle more specific.
  That as M. Angelo&#39;s aim was the &quot;destiny of man, simply
  considered as the subject of religion, faithful or rebellious,&quot;
  admitting only a &quot;general feature of the passions;&quot; so, in
  the hands of Raffaelle, the subject would have teemed with a choice
  of imagery to excite our sympathies; &quot;he would have combined all
  possible emotions with the utmost variety of probable or real
  character; all domestic, politic, religious relations&#8212;whatever
  is not local in virtue and in vice; and the sublimity of the greatest
  events would have been merely the minister of sympathies and
  passions.&quot; The latter mode of representing the subject, that of
  Raffaelle, he considers dramatic. The distinction is, however,
  doubtful: we do not see why the mode of M. Angelo may not be held to
  be equally dramatic. The criticism on the comparison between
  Raffaelle&#39;s and Michael Angelo&#39;s Adam and Eve, if not quite
  just, is striking. &quot;The elevation of Michael Angelo&#39;s soul,
  inspired by the operation of creation itself, furnished him at once
  with the feature that stamped on human nature its most glorious
  prerogative; whilst the characteristic subtility, rather than
  sensibility, of Raffaelle&#39;s mind, in this instance, offered
  nothing but a frigid succedaneum&#8212;a symptom incident to all,
  when, after the subsided astonishment on a great and sudden event,
  the mind, recollecting itself, ponders on it with inquisitive
  surmise. In Michael Angelo, all self-consideration is absorbed in the
  sublimity of the sentiment which issues from the august presence that
  attracts Eve; &#39;her earthly,&#39; in Milton&#39;s expression,
  &#39;by his heavenly overpowered,&#39; pours itself in adoration;
  whilst, in the inimitable cast of Adam&#39;s figure, we trace the
  hint of that half-conscious moment, when sleep began to give way to
  the vivacity of the dream inspired. In Raffaelle, creation is
  complete&#8212;Eve is presented to Adam, now awake; but neither the
  new-born charms, the submissive grace, and virgin purity, of the
  beauteous image; nor the awful presence of her Introductor, draw him
  from his mental trance, into effusions of love or gratitude; at ease
  reclined, with fingers pointing at himself and his <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span> new
  mate, he seems to methodize the surprising event that took place
  during his sleep, and to whisper the words&#8212;&#39;flesh of my
  flesh.&#39;&quot; Not subscribing to any criticism which concludes
  insensibility of mind to Raffaelle, and which is rather inconsistent
  with the judgment made by Mr Fuseli, that he was the painter of
  expression, from the utmost conflict of passions, to the enchanting
  round of gentler emotion, and the nearly silent hints of mind and
  character&#8212;we look to the object of the painter in this his
  series of works called his Bible. The first five pictures represent
  only the act of creation&#8212;the Deity, the Creator&#8212;all
  nature, is as yet passive&#8212;even adoration, the point chosen by
  Michael Angelo, might be said scarcely to have begun&#8212;the plan
  is developed, not put in action. As yet, the Deity is all in
  all&#8212;Eve, his gift to Adam, is the last of this division of the
  series. As in Genesis, there is the bare, short statement, grand from
  its simplicity, and our knowledge of its after consequences; but in
  the words unimpassioned&#8212;so Raffaelle, that he might make his
  pictorial language agree with the written book, with utmost
  forbearance, lest he should tell more, and beyond his authority, in
  this portion of the series manifestly avoids expression, or the
  introduction of any feeling that would make the creatures more than
  the most passive recipients of the goodness of their Maker. Nor is
  there authority to show, that as <i>yet</i> they were fully,
  perfectly conscious of the nature of the gifts of life and
  companionship; and we certainly do not agree with Mr Fuseli, that it
  was a moment for Adam to show his sensibility to the personal charms
  of Eve&#8212;the pure Adam&#8212;nor was he&#8212;the as yet
  untransgressing Adam&#8212;to feel fear, in &quot;the awful presence
  of the Introductor.&quot; Raffaelle&#39;s aim seems to have been, to
  follow the text in its utmost simplicity, that the unlettered might
  read&#8212;and this justifies in him the personality of the Creator,
  and the apparently manual act of his creation, corresponding with the
  words&#8212;&quot;God <i>made</i>.&quot; The &quot;allegoric
  drama&quot; of the Church empire, that fills the stanzas of the
  Vatican, is praised by Mr Fuseli, with a full understanding of the
  purpose of the painter, and feeling for its separate parts. He does
  not cavil, as some have done, at the anachronisms. &quot;When,&quot;
  says an able, reflecting, and very amusing author,<a name=
  "FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
  "fnanchor">[2]</a> &quot;Aristotle, Plato, Leo X., and Cardinal
  Bembo, are brought together in the school of Athens, every person
  must admit, that such offences as these, against truths so obvious,
  if they do not arise from a defect of understanding, are instances of
  inexcusable carelessness.&quot; Here we think this writer has missed
  the key of explanation. The very picture is the history of the
  progress of mind, through science and philosophy, to the
  acknowledgment of an immortal being. The very subject amalgamates, in
  one moral idea, times, epochs, localities. It treats of that which
  passes over time, and embodies only its results. Mr Fuseli notices
  not these anachronisms, but says aptly of the
  picture&#8212;&quot;What was the surmise of the eye and wish of
  hearts, is gradually made the result of reason, in the characters of
  the school of Athens, by the researches of philosophy, which, from
  bodies to mind, from corporeal harmony to moral fitness, and from the
  duties of society, ascends to the doctrine of God and hopes of
  immortality.&quot; The very entertaining author whom we have quoted
  above, we must here, somewhat out of place, observe, has, with Mr
  Fuseli, mistaken the character of Hogarth&#39;s works. He
  says&#8212;&quot;Hogarth has painted comedy!&quot; and what is very
  strange, he seems to rank him as a comedian with &quot;Pope, Young
  and Crabbe&quot;&#8212;the last, the most tragic in his pathos of any
  writer. The invention in the Cartoons comes next under Mr
  Fuseli&#39;s observation. &quot;In whatever light we consider their
  invention, as parts of <i>one whole</i>, relative to each other, or
  independent <i>each of the rest</i>, and as single subjects, there
  can be scarcely named a beauty or a mystery, of which the Cartoons
  furnish not an instance or a clue; <i>they are poised between
  perspicuity and pregnancy of moment</i>.&quot; We believe we
  understand the latter sentence; it is, however, somewhat affected,
  and does not rightly balance the <i>perspicuity</i>. We must go back,
  however, to a passage <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_707" id=
  "Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span> preceding the remarks on the Cartoons;
  because we wish, above all things, to vindicate the purest of
  painters from charges of licentiousness. He sees in Cupid and Psyche
  a voluptuous history: this may or may not be so&#8212;we think it is
  far from being such; but when he adds, &quot;the voluptuous history
  of his (Raffaelle&#39;s) own <i>favourite passion</i>,&quot; he is
  following a prejudice, an unfounded story&#8212;one which we think,
  too, has in no slight degree influenced his general criticism and
  estimation of Raffaelle. We would refer the reader to
  &quot;Passavant&#39;s Life of Raffaelle,&quot; where he will see this
  subject investigated, and the tale refuted. It is surprising, but
  good men affect to speak of amorous passion as if it were a crime; by
  itself it may disgust, but surely coldness is not the better nature.
  Insensibilities of all kinds must be avoided, even where
  &quot;Amor,&quot; as Mr Fuseli calls him, and Psyche are the
  subjects. It is the happiest genius that shall signify without
  offence the necessary existence of passion, and leave purity in its
  singleness and innocence. How exquisitely is this done by Shakspeare
  in his &quot;Romeo and Juliet!&quot; He keeps the lovers free from
  every grosser particle of love, while he throws it all upon the
  subordinate characters, particularly the nurse, whose part in the
  drama, in no small degree, tends to naturalise to our sympathy the
  youth, the personal beauty, and whole loveliness, of the unhappy
  Romeo and Juliet.</p>

  <p>The differences of manner in which the same subject, &quot;the
  Murder of the Innocents,&quot; has been represented by several
  painters, according to the genius of each, are well noticed.
  &quot;History, strictly so called, follows the drama; fiction now
  ceases, and invention consists only in selecting and fixing with
  dignity, precision, and sentiment, the moments of
  <i>reality</i>.&quot; He instances, by a given subject, that were the
  artist to choose the &quot;Death of Germanicus,&quot; he is never to
  forget that he is to represent &quot;a Roman dying amidst
  Romans,&quot; and not to suffer individual grief to un-Romanize his
  subject. &quot;Germanicus, Agrippina, Caius, Vitellius, the Legates,
  the Centurions at Antioch, the hero, the husband, the father, the
  friend, the leader&#8212;the struggles of nature and sparks of hope,
  must be subjected to the physiognomic character and features of
  Germanicus, the son of Drusus, the CÃ¦sar of Tiberius. Maternal,
  female, connubial passion, must be tinged by Agrippina, the woman
  absorbed in the Roman, less lover than companion of her husband&#39;s
  grandeur. Even the bursts of friendship, attachment, allegiance, and
  revenge, must be stamped by the military ceremonial, and distinctive
  costume of Rome.&quot; For an instance of this propriety of invention
  in history, reference is made, we presume as much, to Mr West&#39;s
  &quot;Death of Wolfe.&quot; Undoubtedly, this is Mr West&#39;s best
  picture. The praise from Mr Fuseli was, in all probability, purely
  academic; he frequently showed that he did not too highly estimate
  the genius of the painter. Having given these outlines of general and
  specific invention in the epic, dramatic, and historic branches of
  art, he admits that there is not always a nice discrimination of
  their limits: &quot;and as the mind and fancy of man, upon the whole,
  consist of mixed qualities, we seldom meet with a human performance
  exclusively made up of epic, dramatic, or pure historic
  materials.&quot; This confession, as it appears to us, renders the
  classification useless to a student, and shows a yet incomplete view
  of arrangement, and specification of the power, subjects, and means
  of art.</p>

  <p>Indeed Mr Fuseli proceeds to instances wherein his epic assumes
  the dramatic, the dramatic the epic, and the historic both. There
  does seem something wanting in an arrangement which puts the
  <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, two works essentially different, in
  the same category. We do, therefore, venture the opinion, that such
  distinctions are, more particularly in painting, not available. With
  Sir Joshua, he considers borrowing justifiable, and that it does not
  impair the originality of invention. The instances given of happy
  adoption are the &quot;Torso of Apollonius,&quot; by Michael Angelo;
  of the figure of &quot;Adam dismissed from Paradise,&quot; by
  Raffaelle, borrowed from Massaccio, as likewise the figure of
  &quot;Paul at Athens;&quot; and for figures of Michael Angelo&#39;s,
  Raffaelle, Parmegiano, Poussin, are all indebted to the cartoon of
  Pisa. The lecture concludes with some just remarks upon the
  &quot;Transfiguration,&quot; and a censure upon the coldness of
  Richardson, and the burlesque of the French critic Falconet, who
  could not discover the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_708" id=
  "Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span> point of contact which united the two
  parts of this celebrated picture. &quot;Raphael&#39;s design was to
  represent Jesus as the Son of God, and, at the same time, the
  reliever of human misery, by an unequivocal fact. The transfiguration
  on Tabor, and the miraculous cure which followed the descent of
  Jesus, united, furnished the fact. The difficulty was, how to combine
  two successive actions in one moment. He overcame it, by sacrificing
  the moment of cure to that of the apparition, by implying the lesser
  miracle in the greater. In subordinating the cure to the vision, he
  obtained sublimity; in placing the crowd and patient on the
  foreground, he gained room for the full exertion of his dramatic
  powers. It was not necessary that the demoniac should be represented
  in the moment of recovery, if its certainty could be expressed by
  other means. It is implied, it is placed beyond all doubt, by the
  glorious apparition above; it is made nearly intuitive by the
  uplifted hand and finger of the apostle in the centre, who, without
  hesitation, undismayed by the obstinacy of the demon, unmoved by the
  clamour of the crowd, and the pusillanimous scepticism of some of his
  companions, refers the father of the maniac, in an authoritative
  manner, for certain and speedy help to his Master on the mountain
  above, whom, though unseen, his attitude at once connects with all
  that passes below. Here is the point of contact; here is that union
  of the two parts of the fact in one moment, which Richardson and
  Falconet could not discover.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is with diffidence that we would suggest any thing upon a work
  that has so nearly exhausted criticism; but we will venture an
  observation, and if we are correct, the glory of the subject is
  heightened by its adoption. It has ever appeared to us to have
  purposed showing at one view, humanity in its highest, its divinely
  perfected state, the manhood taken into Godhead; and humanity in its
  lowest, its most forlorn, most degraded state, in the person of a
  demoniac: and this contrast seems acknowledged&#8212;abhorrently
  felt, by the reluctant spirit within the sufferer, whose attitude,
  starting from the effulgence and the power which is yet to heal him,
  being the strong action of the lower part of the picture, and one of
  suffering, throws the eye and mind of the spectator at once and
  permanently from earth to the heavenly vision, to ascending prophets,
  and that bright and central majesty, &quot;whose countenance,&quot;
  Mr. Fuseli observes, &quot;is the only one we know expressive of his
  superhuman nature.&quot; This idea of transformation to a higher
  nature is likewise kept up in the figures of the ascending prophets,
  and the apostles below.</p>

  <p>The Fourth Lecture is in continuation of the
  subject&#8212;Invention; but we have left little space for further
  remarks. In another number of Maga we shall resume our review of the

      <p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href=
      "#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Perhaps the
      author of the lectures received this ill opinion of Pausanias
      from Julius CÃ¦sar Scaliger, who treats him as an impostor; but he
      is amply vindicated by Vossius. He lived in the second century,
      and died very old at Rome. In his account of the numerous
      representations of the
      &#935;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#962;, he seems to throw
      some light upon a passage in Xenophon&#39;s Memorabilia, which,
      as far as we know, has escaped the notice of the commentators. It
      is in the dialogue between Socrates and the courtesan Theodote.
      She wishes that he would come to her, to teach her the art of
      charming men. He replies, that he has no leisure, being hindered
      by many matters of private and public importance; and he adds,
      &quot;I have certain mistresses which will not allow me to be
      absent from them day nor night, on account of the spells and
      charms, which learning, they receive from me&quot;&#8212;

      &#949;&#960;&#969;&#948;&#945;&#962;. Who were these
      &#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#953;? Had he meant the virtues or moral
      qualities, he would have spoken plainer, as was his wont; but
      here, where the subject is the personal beauty, the charms of
      Theodote, it is more in the Socratic vein that he refers to other
      <i>personal</i> charms, which engage his thoughts night and day,
      and keep him at home. Now, it appears too, that Socrates was
      taken to see her, on account of the fame of her beauty, and goes
      to her when she is sitting, or rather standing, to a painter; and
      it is evident from the dialogue, that she did not refuse the
      exhibition of her personal charms. It seems, then, not
      improbable, that Socrates was induced to go to her as the painter
      went, for the advantage of his art as a sculptor, and that the
      art was that one at home, the &#964;&#953;&#962;
      &#966;&#953;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;
      &#963;&#959;&#965; &#949;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#957;. Be that as it
      may, it is extremely probable that the
      &#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#953; were some personifications of
      feminine beauty, upon which he was then at work. Are there, then,
      any such recorded as from his hand? Pausanias says there were.
      &quot;Thus Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, made for the
      Athenians statues of the Graces, before the vestibule of the
      citadel,&quot; And adds the curious fact, that after that time
      the Graces were represented naked, and that these were clothed.

  <h2><a name="SOMETHING_ABOUT_MUSIC" id=
  "SOMETHING_ABOUT_MUSIC"></a>SOMETHING ABOUT MUSIC.</h2>

  <p>Gentle Christians, pity us! We are just returned from a musical
  entertainment, and, with aching head and stunned ears, sit down and
  try to recover our equanimity, sorely disturbed by the infliction
  which, we regret to say, we have survived. Had we known how to faint,
  we had done so on the spot, that ours might have been the bliss of
  being carried out over the heads and shoulders of the audience ere
  the performance had well begun&#8212;a movement that would have
  insured us the unfeigned thanks of all whom we had rescued from their
  distressing situation under pretence of bearing us off, splashing us
  with cold water, causing doors to bang impressively during our exit,
  and the various other <i>petit soins</i> requisite to the conducting
  a &quot;faint&quot; with dignity.</p>

  <p>But it could not be accomplished. We made several awkward
  attempts, so little like, that their only result was our being
  threatened with a policeman it we made any more disturbance; so,
  after a hasty glance round had assured us of the impracticability of
  making our escape in any more everyday style, we sat down with a
  stern resolution of endurance&#8212;lips firmly compressed, eyes
  fixed in a stony gaze on the orchestra, whence issued by turns
  groans, shrieks, and screams, from sundry foully-abused instruments
  of music; accompanied by equally appalling sounds from flat, shrill
  signorinas, quavering to distraction, backed by gigantic
  &quot;basses,&quot; (double ones surely,) who, with voices like the
  &quot;seven devils&quot; of the old Grecian, bellowed out divers
  sentimentalisms about dying for love, when assuredly their most
  proximate danger was of apoplexy.</p>

  <p>Well, the affair came to an end, as, it is to be hoped, will every
  other evil in this wicked world; in a spasm of thankfulness we
  extricated ourselves from the crush, and reached our home, where,
  under the genial influence of quiet and a cup of coffee, we can
  afford to laugh at the past, (our own vehement indignation included,)
  and ruminate calmly on the &quot;how&quot; and the &quot;why&quot; of
  the nuisance, which appears to us as well worthy of being put down by
  act of parliament, as the ringing of muffin bells and crying
  &quot;sweep!&quot;</p>

  <p>It is a perfect puzzle to us by what process the standard of music
  has become so lowered, as to make what is ordinarily served up under
  that name be received as the legitimate descendant of the harmony
  divine which erst broke on the ear of the listening world, when
  &quot;the morning stars sang together;&quot; and, in the first
  freshness of its creation&#8212;teeming with melody&#8212;angels
  deigned to visit this terrestrial paradise, nor turned an exile&#39;s
  gaze to that heaven whose strains were chanted in glad accordance
  with the murmuring stream, and music of the waving
  forest&#8212;which, in its greenness and beauty, seemed but &quot;a
  little lower&quot; than its celestial archetype, for</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Earth hath <i>this</i> variety from heaven.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>(Blessings on the poet for that line! We have a most firm belief
  in Milton, and receive his representations of heaven as we would
  those of a Daguerreotype.)</p>

  <p>But it is even so. There is but one step from the sublime to the
  ridiculous, and this entrancing art, it seems, has taken it; sorely
  dislocating its graceful limbs, and injuring its goodly proportions
  in the unseemly escapade. There&#8212;we have played over a simple
  air, one that thrills through our heart of hearts; and as the notes
  die on our ears, soothing though the strain be, we feel our
  indignation increase, and glow still more fiercely against
  this&#8212;music, as it is by courtesy called, for Heaven knows it
  has no legitimate claim to the name!&#8212;till it reaches the
  crusading point, and we rush headlong to a war of extermination
  against bars, rests, crotchets, quavers&#8212;undaunted even by
  &quot;staves,&quot; and formidable inflated semibreves.</p>

  <p>We hate your crashing, clumsy chords, and utterly spit at and defy
  chromatic passages from one end of the instrument to the other, and
  back again; flats, sharps, and most appropriate &quot;naturals,&quot;
  splattered all over the page. The essential spirit of discord seems
  let loose on our modern music, tainted, as it were, with the moral
  infection that has seized the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span> land; it is music for a
  democracy, not the stately, solemn measure of imperial majesty. Music
  to soothe! the idea is obsolete, buried with the ruffs and
  farthingales of our great-grandmothers; or, to speak more soberly,
  with the powdered wigs and hoops of their daughters. There is music
  to excite, much to irritate one, and much more to drive a really
  musical soul stark mad; but none to soothe, save that which is drawn
  from the hiding-places of the past.</p>

  <p>We should like to catch one of the old masters&#8212;Handel, for
  instance&#8212;and place him within the range of one of our modern
  executioners, to whose taste(!) <i>carte-blanche</i> had been given.
  We think we see him under the infliction. Neither the hurling of wig,
  nor yet of kettle-drum, at the head of the performer, would relieve
  his outraged spirit: he would strangle the offender on the spot, and
  hang himself afterwards; and the jury would, in the first case,
  return a verdict of justifiable homicide, and, in the second, of
  justifiable suicide, with a deodand of no ordinary magnitude on the
  musical instrument that had led to the catastrophe.</p>

  <p>There is no repose, no refreshment to the mind, in our popular
  compositions; they are like Turner&#39;s skies&#8212;they harass and
  fatigue, leaving you certainly wondering at their difficulty, but, as
  certainly, wishing they had been &quot;impossible.&quot; There is to
  us more of touching pathos, heart-thrilling expression, in some of
  the old psalm-tunes, feelingly played, than in a whole batch of
  modernisms. The strains go <i>home</i>, and the &quot;fountains of
  the great deep are broken up&quot;&#8212;the great deep of
  unfathomable feeling, that lies far, far below the surface of the
  world-hardened heart; and as the unwonted, yet unchecked, tear starts
  to the eye, the softened spirit yields to their influence, and shakes
  off the moil of earthly care; rising, purified and spiritualized,
  into a clearer atmosphere. Strange, inexplicable associations brood
  over the mind,</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Like the far-off dreams of paradise,&quot;
  </div>

  <p>mingling their chaste melancholy with musings of a still subdued,
  though more cheerful character. How many glad hearts in the olden
  time have rejoiced in these songs of praise&#8212;how many sorrowful
  ones sighed out their complaints in those plaintive notes, that steal
  sadly, yet sweetly, on the ear&#8212;hearts that, now cold in death,
  are laid to rest around that sacred fane, within whose walls they had
  so often swelled with emotion! Tell us not of neatly trimmed
  &quot;cemeteries,&quot; redolent of staring sunflowers, priggish
  shrubs, and all the modern coxcombry of the tomb; with nicely swept
  gravel walks, lest the mourner should get &quot;wet on&#39;s
  feet,&quot; and vaults numbered like warehouses, where &quot;parties
  may bring their own minister,&quot; and be buried with any form, or
  no form, if they like it better. No, give us the village churchyard
  with its sombre yew-trees, among which</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The dial, hid by weeds and flowers,<br />
    Hath told, by none beheld, the solitary hours;&quot;
  </div>

  <p>its grassy hillocks, and mouldering grave-stones, where haply all
  record is obliterated, and nought but a solitary &quot;resurgam&quot;
  meets the enquiring eye; its white-robed priest reverently committing
  &quot;earth to earth,&quot; in sure and certain hope &quot;of a
  joyful resurrection&quot; to the slumbering clay, that was wont to
  worship within the grey and time-stained walls, whence the mournful
  train have now borne him to his last rest; while on the ivy-clad
  tower fall the slanting golden beams of an autumnal sun, that, in its
  declining glory, seems to whisper of hope and consolation to the
  sorrowful ones, reminding them that the night of the tomb shall not
  endure for ever, but that, so surely as the great orb of day shall
  return on the wings of the morning to chase away the tears of the
  lamenting earth, so surely shall the dust, strewed around that
  temple, scattered though it may be to the winds of heaven, &quot;rise
  again&quot; in the morning of the Resurrection, when death
  &quot;shall be swallowed up in victory.&quot;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;&#39;Tis fit his trophies should be rife<br />
    Around the place where he&#39;s subdued;<br />
    The gate of death leads forth to life.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>But we are wandering sadly from our subject; it is perhaps quite
  as well that we have done so, for we should have become dangerous had
  we dwelt much longer on it. We were on the point of wishing
  (Nero-like) that our popular professors of <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span> the
  tuneful art had but one neck, that we might exterminate them at a
  blow, or hang them with one gigantic fiddle-string; but now, thanks
  to our episode, our exacerbated feelings are so far mollified, that
  we will be content with wishing them sentenced to grind knives on
  oil-less stones with creaking axles, till the sufferings of their own
  shall have taught them consideration for the ears of other
  people.</p>

  <p>But music, real music&#8212;not in the harsh, exaggerated style
  now in the ascendant, but simple, pure, melodious, such as might have
  entranced the soul of a Handel, when, in some vision of night, sounds
  swept from angelic harps have floated around him, the gifted one, in
  whose liquid strains and stately harmonies fall on our ravished ears
  the echoes of that immortal joy&#8212;such we confess to be one of
  our idols, before whose shrine we pay a willing, gladsome homage;
  though now, alas! it must be in dens and caves of the earth, since
  <i>modern</i> heresy has banished it from the temple of Apollo.</p>

  <p>See how Toryism peeps out even in the fine arts! <i>Even</i> did
  we say? They are its legitimate province; &quot;The old is
  better,&quot; is inscribed in glowing character on the portals of the
  past. Old Painting! See the throbbing form start from the pregnant
  canvass&#8212;the &quot;Mother of God&quot; folding her Divine Son to
  her all but celestial arms&#8212;the Son of God fainting beneath a
  load of woe, not his own. Old Poetry! Glorious old Homer, with his
  magic song; and sturdy, oak-like in his strength, as in his verdure,
  old Chaucer. Old Music! Hail, ye inspired sons of the lyre! A noble
  host are ye, enshrined in the hearts of all loyal worshippers of the
  tuneful god. And yet (we grieve to confess it) we, even we, spite of
  all our enthusiasm, have been seen laughing at &quot;old music,&quot;
  the aspiring psalmody of a country church singing-pew.</p>

  <p>Oh, to see the row of performers, the consequential choir,
  transcending in importance (in their own eyes) the clerk, the curate,
  the rector, and even the squire from the great hall, majestic and
  stern though he be, with his awful wig and gold-headed cane! There
  are the fubsy boys&#8212;copied apparently from cherubim&#8212;who,
  with glowing, distended cheeks, are simpering on the ceiling,
  <i>doing</i> the tenor, with wide open mouths that would shame
  e&#39;er a barn-door in the village; their red, stumpy fingers
  sprawling over the music which they are (not) reading. The pale,
  lantern-jawed youths, in yellow waistcoats and tall shirt-collars,
  who look as if they were about to whistle a match, are holloing out
  what is professionally, and in this instance with most distressing
  truth, termed counter. &quot;Counter&quot; it is with a vengeance;
  and not only so, but it is a neck-and-neck race between them and the
  urchins aforesaid, which shall have done first. The shock-headed man,
  with chin dropped into his neckerchief, and mouth twisted into every
  <i>un</i>imaginable contortion, as though grinning through a
  horse-collar, has the bass confided to his faithful keeping; and
  emits a variety of growls and groans truly appalling, though
  evidently to his own great comfort and satisfaction. The bassoon, the
  clarinet, the flute&#8212;but how shall we describe them! Suffice it
  to say, that they appeared to be suffering inexpressible torments at
  the hands of their apoplectic-looking performers; who were all at the
  last gasp, and all determined to die bravely at their posts. And then
  the entranced audience, with half-shut eyes and quivering palms! Oh,
  it was too much; we lost our character typo irretrievably that day;
  half suppressed titters from the squire&#39;s pew were not to be
  borne. In that unhappy moment we sinned away some quarter of a
  century&#39;s unrivalled reputation for good manners and musical
  taste. Old Fiddlestrings never forgave us, never did he vouchsafe us
  another anthem, spite of our entreaties and protestations, and the
  thousand and one apologies for our ill-timed merriment, which our
  fruitful brain invented on the spot. To his dying day he preserved
  the utmost contempt for our judgment, not only in this department of
  the fine arts, but also on every other subject. Not to admire his
  music, was condemnation in every thing&#8212;an unpardonable offence.
  We, who had been his great friend, patron, (or rather he was ours,)
  to whom he had so often condescended on the Saturday evening to hum,
  whistle, and too-too over the tune&#8212;of his own
  composing&#8212;that was to be the admiration of the whole parish on
  the succeeding day&#8212;we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_712"
  id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span>were henceforth to be as the
  uninitiated, and left to find out, and follow, as we best might, the
  very eccentric windings of his Sunday&#39;s asthmatic performance;
  which always went at the rate of three crotchets and a cough, to the
  end of the psalm, which he took care should be an especial long
  one.</p>

  <p>Poor old man! we see him now, with his unruly troop of Sunday
  scholars (in training for some important festival, to the due
  celebration of which their labours were essential) singing, bawling
  we should say, out of time and tune, to the utter discomfiture of his
  irritable temper, (there is nothing like a false note for throwing
  your musical man into a perfect tantrum,) and the bringing down on
  their unlucky heads a smart tap with the bow of his violin, which led
  the harmony. There they stood with their brown cheeks and white
  heads, fine specimens of the agricultural interest; each one of them
  looking as if he could bolt a poor, half-starved factory child at a
  mouthful&#8212;but certainly no singers. It was beyond the power even
  of the accomplished old clerk himself to make then such&#8212;an
  oyster, with its mouth full of sand, would have sung quite as well;
  but still he laboured on with might and main&#8212;with closed eyes,
  and open mouth&#8212;delightedly beating time with his head, as long
  as matters went on not intolerably; for David&#39;s musical soul
  supplied the deficiency in the sounds that entered his unwearied
  ears. And then he sang so loud himself, that he certainly could hear
  no one else, his voice being as monopolizing as the drone of a
  bagpipe&#8212;or as a violent advocate for free trade! Happy urchins
  when this was the case! for they were sure to be dismissed with the
  most flattering encomiums on their vocal powers, when, if truth must
  be told, the good old man had not heard a note.</p>

  <p>But he is gathered to his fathers, and now sleeps beneath the sod
  in the quiet churchyard of&#8212;&#8212;. We well remember his
  funeral. &#39;Twas a lovely day in spring when the long, lifeless
  trees and fields were bursting into all the glory of May&#8212;for
  May was spring then, and not, as now, cousin-german to winter; while
  the gay sunbeams played lovingly, like youth caressing age, on the
  low church-tower, gilding the ivy that waved in wild luxuriance
  around it. Slowly moved on the lowly train that bore to the
  &quot;house appointed for all living&quot; the mortal remains of one
  whom they well loved, and whose removal from among
  them&#8212;essential as he had always seemed to the very identity of
  the village&#8212;was an event they had never contemplated and which
  they now, in its unexpectedness, sorely lamented. The village choir
  preceded it, singing those strains which poor David&#39;s voice had
  so often led; and surely, for once, the spirit of the old man rested
  on his refractory pupils; for rarely have I heard sweeter notes than
  those that swelled on the balmy air, as the dusky procession wound
  its way across the heath, waving with harebells, and along the narrow
  lane, whose hedges were beginning to show the first faint rose, till
  it reached the church porch, where the good rector himself was
  waiting to pay the last token of respect to his humble friend; while
  groups of villagers were loitering around to witness the simple
  rites. Entering within the church, again was the voice of melody
  heard, and again was as sweetly chanted that mournful psalm, which is
  appointed, with such affecting appropriateness, for the burial of the
  dead. &quot;I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not in
  my tongue; I will keep my mouth, as it were, with a bridle, while the
  ungodly is in my sight.&quot; Then came the dull, hollow sound of
  &quot;earth to earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes;&quot; and so,
  amid many tears, (and we confess our eyes were not dry,) closed the
  grave over one who, despite some innocent, though mirth-provoking
  failings, was honoured by all who knew him for the stern, unbending
  integrity of his character, and the strictness with which he
  fulfilled all the duties of life. David was an <i>honest</i> man, one
  whose &quot;word was as good as his bond,&quot; who &quot;promised to
  his hurt, and changed not.&quot; Would that as much might be said of
  many who move in a higher sphere, and make far larger professions of
  sanctity than he did! But he shall be remembered, when their names
  are blotted out for ever.</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 8em;">&quot;Only the actions of the
    just</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Smell sweet in death, and blossom
    in the dust.&quot;</span>
  </div>

  <p>The music which we hear in our <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span> social intercourse, is
  too generally&#8212;we say it in grief, but in
  truth&#8212;detestable. &quot;Like figures on a dial-plate,&quot; sit
  the four-and-twenty Englishmen and Englishwomen, who have been drawn
  together to receive their friend&#39;s hospitality; till the awful
  silence convinces the host that some desperate effort must be made to
  break the spell, and that the best thing is some music to set them
  a-talking. Some <i>mimini-pimini</i> Miss is in consequence selected
  as the victim, (or rather, the victimizer,) and requested to
  &quot;pain&quot; the company. She fidgets, bridles, and duly
  declines, at the same time vigorously pulling off one of her gloves
  in evident preparation for the attack. After much pressing, she
  reluctantly yields to what she had from the first made up her mind to
  do; takes her seat at a grand pianoforte, behind a couple of candles
  and an enormous music-book, and&#8212;crash go the keys in a
  thundering prelude, (the pedal, and every other means of increasing
  the noise being unscrupulously resorted to,) which, after superhuman
  exertions, lands her in what, to our affrighted and stunned ears, is
  evidently the key of Z flat! Who would have thought those delicate
  hands could thus descend with the vigour of a pavior&#39;s hammer on
  the unhappy ivories, that groan and shriek beneath the infliction, as
  though fully sensible of the surpassing cruelty with which they are
  treated.</p>

  <p>But hark! she sings&#8212;&quot;RomÃ¨, RomÃ¨, thou art
  <i>n&#39;more</i>,&quot; (<i>sic</i>)&#8212;a furious scramble on the
  keys, with a concluding bang&#8212;&quot;On thy seven hills thou
  satt&#39;st of yore,&quot;&#8212;another still more desperate and
  discordant flourish, which continues alternating with her &quot;most
  sweet voice,&quot; till she has piped through the whole of her song:
  when the group around, apprehensive of a repetition of the torture to
  which they have been subjected, overwhelm her with thanks and
  expressions of admiration, under cover of which they hurry her to her
  seat. Such is the stuff palmed off on us, varied as it is by glees,
  screamed out by four voices all in different keys; solos, squeaked
  out by stout gentlemen, and roared by pale lanky lads of eighteen;
  duets by young ladies, who accidentally set out on discordant notes,
  and don&#39;t find out the mistake till they come to the finale; with
  occasionally a psalm crooned by worthy sexagenarians, guiltless alike
  of ear and voice, but who, seeming to think it a duty to add their
  mite to the inexpressible dissonance, perform the same to the unmixed
  dismay of all their hearers.</p>

  <p>We would far rather hear an unpretending street organ than such
  abominations; and, indeed, some of the itinerant music is, to our
  unsophisticated ears, sweet beyond expression, especially when
  accompanied, as it is sometimes, by a rich Italian or reedy German
  voice; for whose sake we can forgive the tuneless squalls that too
  often greet our ears from ambulatory minstrels, be they of the
  Madonna, or fishy, Dutch-swamp style of beauty. A sweet-toned street
  organ, heard in the distance, when all around is still, is not a
  thing to be despised, by those who have music enough in their souls
  to respond to the slightest touches of Apollo&#39;s lyre. If the
  heart be but attuned to harmony, it will vibrate to the simplest
  notes, faint though they be, as by the wafting of the evening breeze
  among the chords of a neglected harp, sadly hung upon the willows; it
  will cherish the feeblest idea, and nurture it into perfect melody.
  As love begets love, so does harmony beget its kind in the heart of
  him who can strike the keynote of nature, and listen to the wild and
  solemn sounds that swell from her mysterious treasure-house, and echo
  among her &quot;eternal hills,&quot; while the celestial arch
  concludes and re-affirms the wondrous cadence. But these are secrets
  revealed to none but her loving worshipper; he who, with a
  reverential homage, seeks the hidden recesses of her temple, to bend
  in awe before her purest shrine. From him who lingers heedlessly in
  her antechamber with faint loyalty, they are deeply veiled, and the
  glowing revelations of her favoured ones seem but as the recital of a
  dream to his cold heart: for &quot;to <i>love</i> is to
  know.&quot;</p>

  <p>But surely of all instruments, the violin, first-rately played, is
  the most&#8212;yes, we will say it&#8212;heavenly. Hark! to the
  clear, vocal melody, now rapturously rising in one soul-exalting
  strain, anon melting away in the saddest, tenderest lament, as though
  the soft summer breeze sighed forth a requiem over the dying graces
  of its favourite flower; then bursting <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span> forth in haughty,
  triumphant notes, swept in gusts from the impassioned strings, as
  though instinct with life, and glowing with disdain. Any one may see
  that painters are no musicians, else had they furnished their angels
  not with harps&#8212;beautiful and sparkling as the sea-foam, as are
  their most graceful chords&#8212;but with this, of all instruments
  the most musical, whose tones admit of more variety than any, (the
  Proteus organ alone excepted,) and whose delicious long-drawn notes
  must entrance every one not absolutely soulless. Oh, they are
  excruciatingly delightful! And yet you shall hear this identical
  violin, in the hands of an everyday performer, emit such squeals and
  screams as shall set your teeth on edge for a twelvemonth, curdle
  your whole frame, and make you vehemently anathematize all benevolent
  institutions for the relief of deafness.</p>

  <p>Verily your violin is an exclusive instrument, and approachable by
  none but the eldest born of Apollo, who, in all the majesty of
  hereditary prerogative, calmly sway the dominions of their sire;
  while usurpers (as is the meed of all who grasp unrighteous rule) are
  plunged in utter confusion and ruin.</p>

  <p>Warming with our theme, and impatient to manifest our royal
  descent, in a paroxysm of enthusiasm we clutch our Cremona, clasp him
  lovingly to our shoulder, and high waving in air our magical bow,
  which is to us a sceptre, bring it down with a crash, exulting in the
  immortal harmony about to gush, like a mountain torrent, from the
  teeming strings; when lo! to our unmitigated disgust, it glides
  noiselessly along its hitherto resounding path, for&#8212;ye gods and
  little fishes!&#8212;some murderous wretch, at the instigation of we
  know not what evil sprite, has <i>greased</i> the horsehair, for
  which we solemnly devote him to the &quot;bowstring,&quot; the first
  time he is caught napping.</p>

  <p>Well, it is over now, and we find ourselves once more on earth,
  after knocking our head gainst the stars; and, &#8212;&#8212;
  &#8212;&#8212; bless us! we have sat the fire out, having precisely
  one inch of candle left to go to bed by.</p>

  <p>Good night, dearest reader. Can you find your way in the dark?</p>

  <p>M. J.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_BANKING-HOUSE" id="THE_BANKING-HOUSE"></a>THE
  BANKING-HOUSE.</h2>

  <h2>A HISTORY IN THREE PARTS. PART II.</h2>

  <h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

  <h3>A NEGOTIATION.</h3>

  <p>It is vastly amusing to contemplate the activity and perseverance
  which are exhibited in the regard shown by every man for his
  individual interests. Be our faults what they may&#8212;and our
  neighbours are not slow to discover them&#8212;it is very seldom
  indeed that we are charged with remissness in this respect. So far
  from this being the case, a moralist of the present day, in a work of
  no mean ability, has undertaken to prove that selfishness is the
  great and crying evil of the age. Without venturing to affirm so
  wholesale a proposition, which necessarily includes in its censure
  professors and professions <i>par excellence</i> unsecular and
  liberal, we may be permitted in charity to express our regret, that
  the rewards apportioned to good men in heaven are not bestowed upon
  those in whom the selfish principle is most rampant, instead of being
  strictly reserved for others in whom it is least influential; since
  it is more pleasing to consider celestial joys in connexion with
  humanity at large, than with an infinitesimal minority of
  mortals.</p>

  <p>Whilst Michael Allcraft coolly and designedly looked around him,
  in the hope of fixing on the prey he had resolved to
  find&#8212;whilst, cautious as the midnight housebreaker, who dreads
  lest every step may wake his sleeping victim, he almost feared to do
  what most he had at heart, and strove by ceaseless effort to bring
  into his face the show of indifference and repose;&#8212;whilst he
  was thus engaged, there were many, on the other hand, eager and
  impatient to crave from him, as for a boon, all that he himself was
  but too willing to bestow. Little did Michael guess, on his eventful
  wedding-day, as his noble equipage rattled along the public roads,
  what thoughts were passing in the minds of some who marked him as he
  went, and followed him with longing eyes. His absorbing passion, his
  exhilaration and delight, did not suffer him to see one thin and
  anxious-looking gentleman, who, spyglass in hand, sat at his cottage
  window, and brought as near as art allowed&#8212;not near enough to
  satisfy him&#8212;the entranced and happy pair. That old man, with
  nine times ten thousand pounds safe and snug in the stocks, was
  miserable to look at, and as miserable in effect. He was a widower,
  and had a son at Oxford, a wild, scapegrace youth, who had never been
  a joy to him, but a trial and a sorrow even from his cradle. Such
  punishments there are reserved for men&#8212;such visitations for the
  sins our fathers wrought, too thoughtless of their progeny. How the
  old man envied the prosperous bridegroom, and how vainly he wished
  that his boy might have done as well; and how through his small grey
  eye, the labouring tear-drops oozed, as he called fresh to mind again
  all that he had promised himself at the birth of his unhappy
  prodigal! What would he not give to recover and reform the wayward
  boy? The thought occurred to him, and he dallied with it for his
  pleasure. &quot;If I could but settle him with this young Allcraft!
  Why should it not be done? I will give him all I have at once, if
  necessary, and live in a garret, if it will save my poor Augustus. I
  will speak to him on his return. What a companion and example for my
  boy! Open and straightforward&#8212;steady as a rock&#8212;as rich as
  Cr&#339;sus. Most certainly I&#39;ll see him. I knew his father.
  I&#39;ll not grudge a few thousands to establish him. Stick him to
  business, and he shall do yet.&quot; The equipage rolled on as
  unconscious of the old man&#39;s dreams as were its animated inmates;
  and in due time it passed a massive lodge, which led through green
  and winding paths to the finest park and mansion in the parish. Close
  to the lodge&#39;s porch there stood a tall and gloomy-looking man,
  neatly dressed&#8212;alone. His arms were folded, and he eyed the
  carriage thoughtfully and seriously, as though he had an interest
  there,</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg
  720]</a></span></p>known to himself, and to no one else. He was a
  very proud man that&#8212;the owner of this vast estate, master of
  unnumbered acres, and feared rather than loved by the surrounding
  people. Wealth is the most royal of despots&#8212;the autocrat of all
  the world. Men whose sense of liberty forbids them to place their
  worst passions under wise control, will crawl in fetters to lick the
  basest hand well smeared with gold. There was not an individual who
  could say a good word for the squire behind his back. You would
  hardly believe it, if you saw individual and squire face to face. And
  there he stood, with as ill-omened a visage as ever brought blight
  upon a party of pleasure. He watched the panting horses out of
  sight&#8212;opened his gate, and walked the other way. He, like the
  old man, had his plans, and an itching for a share in Michael
  Allcraft&#39;s fortune. How he, so wealthy and respected, could need
  a part of it, remains a mystery at present. The squire knew his
  business. He went straightway to the banking-house, and made enquiry
  respecting Allcraft&#39;s destination. He gained intelligence, and
  followed him at once. They met abroad&#8212;they returned home in
  company. They became great friends, and within three
  months&#8212;<span class='smcap'>partners</span>. And the old man had
  been, as he threatened to be, very busy likewise. He had fought his
  son&#39;s battle very hardly and very successfully, as he believed,
  and with twenty thousand pounds had purchased for him a junior
  partner&#39;s interest in the estate. The hopeful boy was admitted
  into the concern during his residence in Oxford. He had never been
  seen, but his father was a man of substance, well known and esteemed.
  The character which he gave with his son was undeniable. Its truth
  could not be questioned, backed as it was by so liberal an
  advance.<br />
  <br />

  <p>Let it not be supposed that Michael, in his anxiety to involve
  other men in his own fearful responsibility, was injudicious enough
  to act without all forethought and consideration. Not he. He had
  inherited from his sire the valuable faculty of detecting the wishes
  and views of men in their external evidences. On the countenances of
  men he read their hearts. It did not take long to discover that the
  venerable Mr Brammel and the haughty Mr Bellamy were bent upon the
  partnership, and would secure it at any cost. Satisfied of this, like
  a lazy and plethoric fish he kept within sight of his bait, close
  upon it, without deigning for a time as much as a nibble. It was his
  when he chose to bite. But there were deep enquiries to make, and
  many things to do, before he could implicate himself so far. In every
  available quarter he sought information respecting the one partner,
  and the father of the other, and of both; the intelligence that he
  received well repaid his trouble. Nothing could be more promising and
  satisfactory. Nor did he content himself with such arms against the
  selfishness of gentlemen, who, he was shrewd enough to know, were
  seeking only their own advantage in their earnest desire of a union
  with him. He had an eye to the balance of power. Two men, united and
  active, in the firm, pulling together on all occasions, might, not by
  one blow perhaps, but in the course of time, and by accumulating
  force and skill, oust him from his present elevated and natural
  position. Once admit them to authority, and the limits of their
  dominion must be prescribed by their own sense of honour, or by the
  opportunities afforded them of supremacy and independent action.
  Michael the impulsive saw and felt this most acutely, and took
  occasion, from their eagerness, to insure a proper equilibrium of the
  forces before permitting them to coalesce. There lived in the same
  city with Michael, and within a quarter of a mile of the
  banking-house, an individual to whom he turned his thoughts in his
  emergency. Mr Planner was his name, and his character is worth more
  than a mere passing observation. He was a study for an artist&#8212;a
  lesson for mankind. He was a man of surprising abilities, ill
  directed, and badly educated; at any period of his life capable of
  any thing&#8212;to the last moment of his existence accomplishing
  nothing. From a child he had displayed a love of admiration and
  applause, a craving after superiority and distinction, a burning
  ambition for fame. He had the body of a giant, and a giant&#39;s
  mental apparatus. But with all his gifts, physical and spiritual, all
  his energies and aims, he arrived at middle life a melancholy
  spectacle of failure and incompetency. There was no one object which
  he could pursue with steadiness</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg
  721]</a></span></p>and patience&#8212;no single mark to which he
  could perseveringly apply the combined powers of his gifted
  intellect. He frittered his faculties upon a hundred trifles, never
  concentrated them upon a worthy purpose once. Pride, emulation, and
  the internal consciousness of strength, led him, year after year, and
  day after day, into difficulties and trials, and carried him through
  them only to drag him into deeper. There was no one man whom he would
  allow to perform any one thing so skilfully as himself. There was no
  branch of knowledge into which he did not grope his way, and from
  which he would not manage to extract sufficient learning to render
  his conceit intolerable, and his opposition dangerous to a more
  erudite antagonist. He could build a church&#8212;dam a
  river&#8212;form a company&#8212;warm a house&#8212;cool a
  room&#8212;one and all he would undertake at a minute&#39;s notice,
  and engage to execute better than any person living. He asserted it
  with confidence, and you believed him when he spoke with all the
  earnestness of self-conviction and of truth. He despised all
  works&#8212;all theories but his own; and these were unapproachable,
  inimitable. He wrote with his own invented pen, used his own ink, sat
  on his own chair, made with his own incomparable tools. Men were
  ignorant, behind their age&#8212;burdened with superstitions, clogged
  by false principles. This was a text from which he never ceased to
  preach. As a youth he was engaged in profitable business. Before he
  reached his thirtieth year he had realized a handsome competency. He
  retired from his occupation, and went abroad to found a city across
  the ocean, with views that were unknown to man, and which, well
  carried out, must prove infallible. He chose a spot removed from
  civilized society&#8212;lived for three years amongst a tribe of
  savages, and came home at last without a farthing in his
  scrip&#8212;beggared but not depressed. He had dwelt for many months
  in a district of swamps, and he had discovered a method of draining
  lands cheaper and more effectual than any hitherto attempted. He
  contracted to empty some thousand acres&#8212;began his work,
  succeeded for a time, and failed at last, from having falsely
  calculated his expenses, and for lack of means to carry out his
  plans. There were few public matters in which Mr Planner did not
  meddle. He wrote pamphlets, and &quot;hints,&quot; and &quot;original
  views&quot; by dozens. His articles on the currency and corn-laws
  were full of racy hits and striking points&#8212;his criticisms on
  the existing state of art worthy of the artist&#39;s best attention.
  The temper of Mr Planner was such as might be expected from such a
  mass of arrogance and conceit. A man who, in the easiness of his
  heart, would listen humbly, patiently, approvingly to Mr Planner,
  must pronounce the ardent character an angel. The remarkable docility
  which Mr Planner evinced under such treatment, was only to be
  equalled by the volubility and pleasure with which he communicated
  his numerous and ingenious ideas. Sceptics&#8212;nay, men who had
  ventured only to contend for the soundness of their preconceived
  ideas, and who had been met with a torrent of vituperation and
  reproach in consequence&#8212;did not hesitate to call Mr
  Planner&#8212;the devil incarnate. Such as he was, he had become an
  agent and a tool in the hands of Allcraft&#39;s father. Michael had
  been his friend for years, and Planner liked the boy who had ever
  regarded him with awe and veneration. The youth had been taught by
  his parent to note the faults and inconsistencies of his character;
  but these had not rendered him insensible to the talents which had
  commanded even that discerning parent&#39;s respect and admiration.
  It was this personage, for some years the hanger-on at the bank, and
  the traveller and negotiator of many things for Allcraft senior,
  whose name suggested to Michael the means of providing against the
  encroachments of his future brethren. Planner could be relied upon.
  The smallest possible interest in the business would excite in him a
  corresponding interest in its prosperity, and secure his steadiness
  and good behaviour. Why not offer it then, and make his entrance into
  the firm a <i>sine qua non</i> in the bargain with Bellamy and
  Brammel? He revolved the matter, and saw no real objection to it.
  Planner was reputed a first-rate accountant; his services would be
  important, no remuneration could be too great, provided he would
  settle down, and fix his energies upon the one great object of
  advancing the welfare of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_722"
  id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span> establishment. His friendship was
  secured, and a word or two would suffice to gain his faithful support
  and co-operation. So far from his becoming burdensome and useless in
  the bank, his talents would be in every way desirable. A coadjutor,
  such as he might be, firm and trusty, was invaluable. And why should
  he not be? A day had been fixed for accepting or rejecting the
  propositions of the gentlemen. The time was drawing on, when Michael
  visited his friend to sound him on his purpose.<br />
  <br />

  <p>Planner lived in a very humble part of a very humble house, in a
  very humble street. The two-pair back was his domain, and his
  territory was less adorned than crowded with the evidences of his
  taste and handiwork. In the remote corner of his unclean apartment
  was a lathe for turning ivory&#8212;near it the material, a monstrous
  elephant&#39;s tusk. Shelves, carried round the room, supported
  bottles of various sizes, externally very dirty, and internally what
  you please; for eyes could not penetrate so far, and determine the
  contents. A large label, crowning all, announced them to be
  &quot;samples.&quot; Books were strewed every where&#8212;manuscripts
  met you at every turn. The walls were filled with charts and
  drawings, one of the former representing the field of Waterloo,
  dissected and intersected, with a view to prove Lord Wellington
  guilty of winning a battle, which, in conformity with every law of
  strategy, he should have lost. One drawing was a rough sketch of his
  unhappy swamp; another, the elaborate delineation of a hydraulic
  pump. In the niche corresponding to that in which the lathe was
  fixed, there was a small iron bedstead; and in this, although it was
  nearly noon when Michael paid his friendly visit, Mr Allcraft caught
  sight of Mr Planner when he opened the door, in obedience to the very
  sharp and loud voice which invited him to &quot;walk in.&quot; The
  ingenious gentleman had breakfasted. The tea things were on a stool
  at his side. He wore his nightcap, and he was busy in examining a
  crimson liquid, which he held in a glass close to his eyes.
  &quot;That man was murdered, Allcraft!&quot; exclaimed Mr Planner
  after the briefest possible salutation. &quot;Murdered, as I am a
  living Christian!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What man?&quot; asked Allcraft.</p>

  <p>&quot;Him they hanged last week for poisoning his father. What was
  the evidence? Why, when they opened the body, they found a grain or
  two of arsenic. Hang a man upon that! A pretty state of
  things&#8212;look here, sir&#8212;look here!&quot;&#8212;and he
  pointed triumphantly to his crimson liquid.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is that, Mr Planner?&quot; inquired the visitor.</p>

  <p>&quot;What? My blood, sir. I opened a vein the very day they
  hanged him. I suspected it all along, and there it is. There is more
  arsenic there, sir, than they found in the entire carcass of that
  man. Arsenic! Why, it&#39;s a prime ingredient in the blood. This it
  is to live in the clouds. Talk of dark ages&#8212;when shall we get
  light?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was not aware, Mr Planner,&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course you were not. How should you be? It is the
  interest of the ruling powers to darken the intellect of society. Why
  am I kept down? Why don&#39;t I prosper? Why don&#39;t my works sell?
  Ah, Allcraft&#8212;put that small pamphlet in your pocket&#8212;there
  it is&#8212;under the model&#8212;take care what you are
  about&#8212;don&#39;t break it&#8212;there, that&#39;s right! What is
  it called?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Popular delusions.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, true enough!&#8212;put it into your pocket and read it.
  If Pitt could be alive to read it!&#8212;-- Well, never mind! I say,
  Allcraft, how does that back room flue get on&#8212;any smoke
  now?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No. I should think not. Michael, I must say it, though the
  old gentleman is dead, he was one of the hardest fellows to move I
  ever met. He would have been smoke-dried&#8212;suffocated, years ago,
  if it hadn&#39;t been for me. I was the first man that ever sent
  smoke up that chimney. Nobody could do it, sir. A fellow came from
  London, tried, and failed.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is a pity, Mr Planner, that, with abilities like yours,
  you have not been more successful in life. Pardon me if I say that
  success would have made you a quieter and a happier man.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, Michael, so your father used to say! Well, I don&#39;t
  know&#8212;people are such fools. They will not think for themselves,
  and they are ready to crush any one who offers to think for them. It
  has ever been so. Men in advance of their generation have always
  fared badly. Ages ago they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_723"
  id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span> were put to death cruelly and
  violently. Now they are left to starve, and die. The creatures are
  ignorant, but they are worse than that; they are selfish and jealous,
  and will rather sit in gloom, than owe light, and confess they owe
  it, to a fellow mortal and a superior spirit.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am afraid, Mr Planner, after such an observation, that you
  will hardly give me credit for the feeling which has induced me to
  visit you this morning.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a good fellow, Michael. You were always a
  generous-hearted lad&#8212;an exception to the general rule. When you
  were five years old, you used to share your biscuits with me. It was
  a fine trait in your character. Proceed.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are aware, Mr Planner, that through my father&#39;s
  death increased responsibilities have come upon me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You may say that. He never would take my advice about the
  bank-notes. Stop&#8212;remind me before you go, of the few hints to
  bankers, which I drew up. You will do well to look at them.
  You&#39;ll see the advantages of my system of paper issues. Your
  father, sir, was stone-blind to his own interests&#8212;&#8212; but I
  am interrupting you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have for some time past determined to associate with me in
  the bank, two gentlemen of noble fortunes and the first
  respectability. I would not willingly carry on the concern alone, and
  the accession of two such gentlemen as I describe, cannot but be in
  every way desirable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Humph&#8212;go on.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Now Mr Planner, you are a very, very old friend of my
  father&#39;s, and I know he valued your advice as it deserved to
  be.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The old gentleman was good in the main, Michael.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Had he been aware of my position, he would have recommended
  the step which I am about to adopt. Mr Planner, I am young, and
  therefore inexperienced. These gentlemen are very worthy persons no
  doubt; indeed, I am assured they are; still, they are comparatively
  strangers to me, and I am certain you would advise me to be most
  cautious.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Proceed.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What I feel to want is the constant presence of a
  friend&#8212;one who, from personal attachment, may have my welfare
  and interest at heart, and form as it were a second self at all
  times&#8212;let me be present or absent&#8212;and absent I must be
  very often&#8212;you perceive?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A sort of counterpoise to the opposite weight, in fact, if I
  may be allowed to call it so. Now, I can sincerely affirm that I know
  no person, Mr Planner, in whom I could rely so entirely and
  unreservedly as yourself; and nothing would give me greater pleasure
  than to serve a man so highly gifted, so long connected with our
  family by the closest friendship. If you think the occupation of a
  banker suitable to your present tastes, I believe that I can offer
  you an appointment worthy your serious consideration.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Planner rose in his bed, and grasped firmly the hand of Mr
  Michael Allcraft. The latter sat at the bedside until past three
  o&#39;clock, and then retired, leaving his friend in a state of great
  mental excitement. When Michael, upon taking his departure, reached
  the street door, he stopped short, and retraced his steps. Entering
  the apartment for a second time, he discovered Mr Planner in his
  night clothes, standing before a looking glass, and repeating one of
  his own compositions in a voice of thunder, and with the most
  vehement gesticulation.</p>

  <p>&quot;I beg your pardon. You told me to remind you, Planner, of
  your hints to bankers. Have you the book handy?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is here, Michael. Read it attentively, my boy&#8212;trust
  to me. I&#39;ll make the house&#39;s name ring throughout the
  country. Don&#39;t forget what I have said. We must have a new faÃ§ade
  to the old building after a while. I have such a plan for
  it!&quot;</p>

  <h3><a name="THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_II" id=
  "THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>

  <h3>A LULL.</h3>

  <p><i>Allcraft, Bellamy, Brammel, and Planner</i>. It was a goodly
  ship that bore the name, and fair she looked at the launching; her
  sails well set, her <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_724" id=
  "Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span> streamers flying, and the music of
  men&#39;s voices cheering her on her career. Happy and prosperous be
  her course! We think not of winter&#39;s cold in the fervent summer
  time, and wreck and ruin seem impossible on the smooth surface of the
  laughing sea; yet cold and winter come, and the smiling,
  sweet-tempered ripple can awaken from slumber, and battle and storm
  with the heavens. Never had bark left haven with finer promises of
  success. We will follow her from the port, and keep watchfully in the
  good ship&#39;s wake.</p>

  <p>Michael formed a just conclusion when he reckoned upon increase of
  business. His own marriage, and the immense wealth of his lady, had
  inspired the world with unbounded confidence. The names of two of his
  partners were household words in the county, and stood high amongst
  the best. A convulsion of nature may destroy the world in half an
  hour, as love, it is said, <i>may</i> transform a man into an oyster;
  but either of these contingencies was as remote as the possibility of
  Allcraft&#39;s failure. Silently and successfully the house went on.
  For a quarter of a year the sun shone brightly, and profit, and
  advantage, and honour, looked Michael in the face. Thriving abroad,
  happy at home, what did he need more? His spirit became
  buoyant&#8212;his heart carefree and light. He congratulated himself
  upon the prudence and success of his measures, and looked for his
  reward in the brilliant future which he had created for himself and
  earned. His soul was calmed; and so are the elements, fearfully and
  oppressively, sometimes an hour before the tempest and the storm.</p>

  <p>At the end of three months, Michael deemed it necessary to go
  abroad. The heaviest of his father&#39;s debts had been contracted
  with a house in Lyons, and notices as to payment had been conveyed to
  him&#8212;notices as full of politeness as they were of meaning. The
  difficulties in which he had found himself at the death of his
  parent&#8212;the seriousness of his engagements&#8212;and the
  wariness which he had been compelled to exercise&#8212;had gone far
  to sober down the impetuous youth, and to endue him with the airs and
  habits of a man of business. He had attended to his duties at the
  banking-house faithfully and punctually. He had entered into its
  affairs with the energy and resolution of a practical and working
  mind. He had given his heart to the work, and had put his shoulder to
  the wheel, honestly and earnestly. Whatsoever may have been his
  faults previously to his connexion with his partners, it is due to
  him to say that he was no sluggard afterwards, and that he grudged
  neither time nor labour that could be in any way productive to the
  house&#8212;could add a shilling to its profits, or a breath of
  reputation to its name. To pay his father&#39;s debts from the
  earnings of the bank&#8212;to keep those debts a secret&#8212;and to
  leave the fortune of his wife untouched, were the objects for which
  he lived, and soon began to slave. Believing that a favourable
  arrangement could be effected with his father&#39;s creditors, he
  determined to visit them in person. He had not been absent from the
  bank even for a day; and now, before he could quit it with comfort,
  he deemed it necessary to have a few parting words with his right
  hand and factotum, Planner.</p>

  <p>Planner was the only member of the firm who lived in the
  establishment. His specimens, his bottles, his maps, and drawings,
  had been removed to a spacious apartment over the place of business,
  and he rejoiced in the possession of an entire first floor. His
  bed-room had now a distinct existence. He had not enjoyed it for a
  week, before the water with which he performed his daily ablutions
  was insinuated by a cunning contrivance through the ceiling, and
  dismissed afterwards, as cleverly, through the floor. Hot water came
  through the wall at any hour of the day, and a constant artificial
  ventilation was maintained around his bed by night and day. There was
  no end to the artifices which the chamber exhibited. Michael,
  although he lived at a considerable distance from the bank, was
  always the first at his post, after Planner himself. He arrived
  unusually early on the day fixed for his visit to the Continent.
  Planner and he sat for an hour together, and in the course of their
  conversation, words to the following effect escaped them:&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;You will be careful and attentive, Planner. Let me hear from
  you by every post. Do not spare ink and paper.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Trust me. I shall not forget it. But don&#39;t you miss the
  opportunity, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_725" id=
  "Page_725">[Pg 725]</a></span> Allcraft, of doing something with
  those mines. Your father wouldn&#39;t touch them&#8212;but he
  repented it. I tell you, Michael, if we bought them, and worked them
  ourselves, we might coin money! I&#39;d go abroad and see the shafts
  sunk. I could save a fortune in merely setting them to
  rights.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is rather strange, Planner, that Brammel is so long
  absent. He should come home, and settle down to work. It isn&#39;t
  well to be away. It hasn&#39;t a fair appearance to the world. You
  saw his father yesterday. What said he?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, that young Brammel had a good many things to arrange in
  Oxford and in the neighbourhood, and would soon be back now. But
  never mind him, Allcraft. Between ourselves, he is better where he
  is; he is a horrible ass.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hush. So he is, Planner, but he must not run wild. We must
  keep him at home. He has been a rackety one, and I fear he is not
  much better now. I question whether I should have received him here,
  if I had known as much of him at first as I have heard lately. But
  his father deceived me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Queer old man that, Michael! How he takes the boy&#39;s part
  always, and how frightened he seems lest you should think too badly
  of him. Young Brammel will have every farthing of the old man&#39;s
  money at his death. A pretty sum, too. A hundred thousand pounds,
  isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, Planner, let me know when he returns. That was a
  curious report about his marriage. Can it be true?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;His father denies it, but you mustn&#39;t trust the old
  sinner when he talks about his son. He&#39;ll lie through thick and
  thin for him. They do say he lived with the girl at the time he was
  at college, and married her at last because her brother threatened to
  kick him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense, Planner.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why nonsense? More than half the marriages you hear of are
  scarcely a whit better. What are the rules for a correct match? Who
  obeys them? Where do you ever hear, now-a-days, of a proper marriage?
  People are inconsistent in this respect as in other things. A beauty
  marries a beast. A philosopher weds a fool. They can&#39;t tell you
  why, but they do it. It&#39;s the perversity of human
  nature.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I shall look sharp after Brammel.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Take my advice, Michael, and look after the mines. Brammel
  can take care of himself, or his wife and brother-in-law can do it.
  The timber on the property will realize the purchase money.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, we shall see; but here is Mr Bellamy. Mind you write
  to me, and be explicit and particular.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I shall do it, Michael.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And mark, Planner; prudence&#8212;prudence.&quot;</p>

  <p>And so saying, Michael advanced to Bellamy with a smiling
  countenance. An hour afterwards, both he and his lovely bride were
  comfortably seated in a post-chaise and four, admiring the
  garden-land of Kent, and speeding to Dover fast as their horses could
  carry them.</p>

  <h3><a name="THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_III" id=
  "THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

  <h3>A SWEET COUPLE.</h3>

  <p>The very emphatic and somewhat vulgar expression of Mr Planner,
  was by no means ill-chosen to express the character of Augustus
  Theodore Brammel. He had been lovingly spoiled from his
  cradle&#8212;humoured and ruined with the most praiseworthy care and
  perseverance. His affectionate parents had studiously neglected the
  few goodly shoots which the youth had brought into the world with
  him, and had embarked all their energies in the cultivation of the
  weeds that grew noxious and numerous around the unhappy boy&#39;s
  heart. His mother lived to see her darling expelled from
  Eton&#8212;the father to see much worse, and yet not the worst that
  the hopeful one was doomed to undergo. Gross vices, if not redeemed,
  are rendered less hideous by intellectual power and brilliancy.
  Associated with impotency and ignorance, they are disgusting beyond
  expression. Augustus Brammel was the most sensual and self-engrossed
  of men&#8212; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_726" id=
  "Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span> the most idle and dissipated; and, as
  if these were not enough to render him an object of the deepest
  aversion, he was as self-willed, thick-headed, overbearing a dunce as
  ever moved a man to that contempt &quot;which wisdom holds unlawful
  ever;&quot; and Brammel was not only a fool, but a conceited,
  upstart, irritating fool. He considered himself the shrewdest of
  mortals, and presumed to dictate, to be impertinent, to carry matters
  with a high hand and a flourish. As for modesty, the word was not in
  his dictionary. He had never known its meaning; and therefore,
  perhaps, in justice is not to be blamed for the want of it. Augustus,
  being a great blusterer, was of course a low coward. He bullied,
  oppressed, and crushed the helpless and the weak, who were avenged as
  often as he cowered and sneaked beneath the look of the strong and
  the brave. The companions and friends of such creatures as Brammel,
  are generally selected from the lower grades of life. The tone of
  feeling found amongst the worst members of these classes, harmonizes
  with their own. They think the like thoughts, talk the same language.
  They are led to them by the true Satanic impulse, for it is their
  triumph to reign in hell&#8212;their misery to serve in heaven.
  Flattered by the dregs and refuse of society, they endeavour to
  forget that they are avoided, spurned, trodden on, by any thing
  higher. Just when it was too late to profit by the discovery, old
  Brammel found out his mistake; and then he sagaciously vowed, that if
  his time were to come over again, he would educate his boy in a very
  different manner. His first attempt had certainly been a failure.
  Augustus had been rusticated at the university; he had run away from
  his home; he had committed all kinds of enormity. He had passed weeks
  in the sinks of London, and had been discovered at last by his
  heartbroken parent amongst the stews of Shadwell, in a fearful state
  of disease and destitution. Years were passed in proceedings of this
  nature, and every attempt at recovery proved abortive and useless.
  His debts had been discharged a dozen times, and on every occasion
  under a solemn engagement that it should be the last. When Brammel
  senior signed the deed of partnership on behalf of his son, the
  latter, as I have already said, was in Oxford, having returned to the
  university only a month before, at the termination of his period of
  banishment. Whilst the father was engaged in publishing the imaginary
  virtues of his son to most admiring listeners, the promising youth
  himself was passing his days in the very agreeable society of Miss
  Mary Anne Waters, the eldest daughter of the cook of his
  college&#8212;a young lady with some pretension to beauty, but none
  whatever to morality, being neither more nor less than Mr Augustus
  Brammel&#39;s very particular and <i>chÃ¨re amie</i>. The letter which
  arrived with the unwelcome intelligence of the arrangement, found the
  charming pair together. A specimen of their discourse at the time,
  will show the temper with which the communication was received.</p>

  <p>&quot;I sha&#39;n&#39;t go,&quot; ejaculated the youth. &quot;I
  can&#39;t be nailed down to a desk. What business had the old man to
  do any thing without me? Why can&#39;t he mind his own affairs?
  He&#39;s old and ugly enough. It&#39;s cursed impudence in him, and
  that&#39;s a fact.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh ducky!&quot; interposed Miss Mary Anne, with a rueful
  face, &quot;I know how it will be. You&#39;ll have to go home for
  good, and you won&#39;t think of me no more.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t you bother yourself. I sha&#39;n&#39;t do any
  thing of the kind. If I go home, Molly, you go with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you mean it, dear bless-ed?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t I? that&#39;s all. I say it is blasted impertinent
  in the old man, and I shall tell him so. I shall have blunt enough
  when his toes are up. What is the good of working for more?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh dear me, bless-ed!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What is the matter, old girl?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you should ever forget me!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t you fear.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should hang myself up to the bedpost with my garters. I
  know I should. Don&#39;t leave me, there&#39;s a dear
  ducky.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, haven&#39;t I said I won&#39;t?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, you think you won&#39;t, dear bless-ed!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I tell you I won&#39;t.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but when they get you up, they&#39;ll just be trying to
  marry you to some fine rich woman; and I am sure she won&#39;t know
  how to take care of you as I do. They ain&#39;t brought up to air and
  mend linen, to darn stockings, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span> and to tack on
  shirt-buttons. They&#39;ll never suit you, ducky.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Catch me marrying a fine woman, Moll!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ha, won&#39;t you though, bless-ed? Oh, dear me!&quot; Mary
  Anne burst into tears.</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Moll, now?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, dear ducky! I wish I was an honest woman. I might go
  every where with you, and not be ashamed of it either; and I do love
  you so. I shall die if you leave me&#8212;I know I shall!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I won&#39;t leave you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, there&#39;s a ducks! But you know what you promised me,
  Tiddy dear?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I know, Molly, and I&#39;ll keep my word with you. If
  father makes a partner of me, he shall make partners of both of
  us.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, do you mean it though?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Haven&#39;t I said it, you stupid?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, you dear ducks of diamonds! You do look so handsome
  this morning! And when shall it be? If you are to go to this
  business, the sooner the better, you know, darling. Oh, I shall be so
  happy!&quot;</p>

  <p>Happy or not, the lady was at least successful. In the course of a
  week Mary Anne Waters became extinct, and from her ashes rose the
  surprizingly fine, and surpassingly vulgar, Mrs Augustus Brammel.
  Augustus, notwithstanding his vapoury insubjection, visited his
  father and the partners in the bank, leaving his bride in snug
  lodgings at a respectable distance from all. He remained a few days
  at the banking-house, and then absented himself on the plea of
  finally arranging his incompleted affairs in Oxford and elsewhere. He
  had engaged to return to business at the end of a month. Nearly three
  had passed away, and no tidings whatever had been heard of him.
  Allcraft, as it has been seen, grew anxious&#8212;less perhaps for
  his partner&#39;s safety, than for the good name and credit of the
  firm. He had heard of his precious doings, and reports of his
  inauspicious marriage were already abroad. No wonder that the
  cautious and apprehensive Michael trembled somewhat in his state of
  uncertainty. As for Mr Augustus Brammel himself, the object of his
  fears, he, in conformity with general custom, and especially in
  compliance with the wishes of his wife, had quitted England on a
  wedding tour. With five hundred pounds in his purse&#8212;a sum
  advanced by his father to liquidate his present outstanding
  liabilities&#8212;he steamed from Dover on the very day that he was
  supposed to have reached Oxford for his final arrangements. From
  Boulogne, he, his wife, and suite, proceeded to Paris; and there they
  were, up to their eyes in the dissipation of that fascinating city,
  when Allcraft started on their track, followed them, unwittingly
  enough, from town to town, and came upon them at length in the great
  city itself, and in the very hotel in which they lodged. It was at
  night that Michael first caught sight of the runaway. And where? In a
  gaming-house, the most fashionable of the many legalized haunts of
  devils in which, not many years since, Paris abounded. Allcraft had
  entered upon the scene of iniquity as into a theatre, to behold a
  sight&#8212;the sight of human nature in its lowest, most pitiable,
  and melancholy garb; in its hour of degradation, craziness, and
  desperation. He had his recreation in such a spectacle, as men can
  find their pleasure in the death-struggle of a malefacter on the
  gibbet. He came, not to join the miserable throng that crowded round
  the tables, exhibiting every variety of low, unhealthy feeling; nor
  did he come, in truth, prepared to meet with one in whose affairs and
  conduct he had so deep an interest. It was with inexpressible
  astonishment and horror that he beheld his colleague, busy and active
  amongst the busiest of the crew, venturing rouleau after rouleau,
  losing stake upon stake, and growing more reckless and madder with
  every new defeat. For a time Michael would not, could not, believe
  his own eyes. It was one of the curious resemblances which we meet
  every now and then in life: it was any thing but what he dreaded it
  to be&#8212;the actual presence of Augustus Brammel. Michael
  retreated to a distant part of the room, and watched his man. The
  latter spoke. He used a disgusting English oath, and flung his last
  rouleau across the table like a drunken fiend. The heart of Allcraft
  grew sick, but still he kept his eye upon the gamester. Losing his
  stake, Brammel quitted the apartment, and retired to a spacious
  saloon, splendidly furnished. He called for <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
  champagne&#8212;drank greedily&#8212;finished the
  bottle&#8212;returned to the gaming-room flushed and
  feverish&#8212;looked at the players savagely, but sottishly, for a
  few moments, and then left the house altogether. Michael was on his
  heels. The worthy Brammel stopped at many small public-houses on his
  road, in each drank off a glass of brandy, and so went on. Michael
  had patience, and kept to his partner like a leech. It was midnight
  when he found himself once more before his hotel.</p>

  <p>Brammel had rung at the porter&#39;s bell, and gained admittance.
  A quarter of an hour afterwards Allcraft followed his example. Before
  he retired to rest he learnt that Brammel and himself were inmates of
  the same house. About eleven o&#39;clock on the following morning,
  Augustus quitted his dressing-room. Michael had been waiting some
  hours for this operation. A few minutes afterwards Mr Brammel&#39;s
  servant announced a visitor. Great was the consternation of Augustus
  Brammel when Mr Michael Allcraft looked him in the face. First the
  delinquent turned very white, like a guilty man&#8212;then his colour
  returned to him, and he tried to laugh like an innocent and careless
  one; but he was not so happy in the second instance. As a third
  experiment, he smoothed his hair with his fingers&#8212;pointed to a
  chair&#8212;and held out his hand. Mrs Brammel was at the breakfast
  table, reading an English newspaper.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! Mr Allcraft&#8212;glad to see you&#8212;glad to see you.
  Out on the same business, eh? Nothing like it&#8212;first weeks of
  marriage are delightful&#8212;there&#39;s nothing like a honey-moon
  on the Continent to my thinking. Mrs Brammel, my wife&#8212;Mr
  Allcraft, my partner, my dear.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mrs Brammel looked up from her newspaper and giggled.</p>

  <p>&quot;I cannot tell you, Mr Brammel,&quot; said Allcraft in a
  serious tone, &quot;how surprised I am to find you here. Are you
  aware, sir, that neither your father, nor any one of your partners,
  have the least knowledge of your movements. You were supposed to be
  in England. You gave your word to return to business within a month
  of your departure. You have not written or given the slightest
  account of yourself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come, that&#39;s very good, Mister. Given an account of
  myself, indeed! Pray, whom am I accountable to?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To those, sir,&quot; replied Allcraft, quickly and angrily,
  &quot;with whom you are associated in business, and who have an
  interest in your good conduct&#8212;who suffer by your acts, and will
  be blamed for your folly and indiscretion.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come, I say, that&#39;s all very fine in you, Mr Allcraft;
  but what brings you here, I should like to know? Haven&#39;t I as
  much right to bring my wife to Paris as you have? Give and take, if
  you please&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, bless-ed,&quot; sagely and sarcastically interposed Mrs
  Brammel, &quot;I ain&#39;t so rich as Mrs Allcraft; I can&#39;t dress
  so fine; we ain&#39;t sich gentle-folks&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr Brammel, pray let us have no more recrimination. I have
  met you here by the merest chance. It is my duty to speak to you at
  once, and very seriously, on your position. You are mistaken if you
  suppose that my own pleasure has brought me here;
  business&#8212;important, weighty business&#8212;is the sole cause, I
  can assure you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Ally&#8212;ally</i>,&quot; answered Brammel with a
  knowing leer, attempting a little <i>facetiÃ¦</i> in French.</p>

  <p>&quot;I tell you the truth, sir,&quot; continued Michael,
  reddening with anger, &quot;and I warn you in good time to look to
  yourself, and to your course of conduct. You may bring infamy upon
  yourself, as you have brought sorrow and anguish upon the head of
  your aged father; but you shall not with impunity involve and
  disgrace others who are strangers to you, although unfortunately
  connected with you by their occupation. Depend upon it, you shall
  not.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My aged father, as you call him, didn&#39;t stump up all
  that money, I&#39;m thinking, Mr Allcraft, to bind me apprentice.
  Perhaps you&#39;d like to kick me next. I am as much a partner in
  that concern as you are; and if I think proper to take my lady
  abroad, I am at liberty to do it as well as you. You ain&#39;t the
  first man because you married a rich widow, and because your name
  begins with A. Certainly not, monsweer.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In course not, bless-ed. Besides, ducky, your name begins
  with B&#8212;and that&#39;s A&#39;s next door neighbour.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You shall take your own course, sir,&quot; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span>
  proceeded Michael; &quot;but it shall be at your own peril, and with
  your eyes opened. It is my part to give you good counsel. I shall do
  so. You may act as you then think fit.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I haven&#39;t done any thing to disgrace you, as you call
  it. It is cursed impudent in you to say so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You have. You disgraced yourself and me, and every one
  associated with you, only last night, when you were pleased to
  exhibit to the world as a public gamester. (Augustus Theodore changed
  colour.) You see that your actions are observed; they will become
  more so. The house shall not lose its good name through your
  misconduct, sir. Assure yourself of that. There are means to rid
  ourselves of a nuisance, and to punish severely, if we choose to use
  them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you mean by punish?&quot; asked Augustus,
  unfeignedly alarmed by his partner&#39;s threat, and yet not liking
  to be bullied. &quot;Don&#39;t you insult me, sir, in my own room;
  better not, I can tell you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Pshaw, you are an idiot;&quot; exclaimed Michael most
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll just thank you to go, sir, and not call my husband
  names,&quot; said Mrs Brammel, rising from her chair. &quot;You are a
  nasty ill-bred fellow, I&#39;m sure. Talk of high people! I never see
  sich airs in all my life. If your wife ain&#39;t no better behaved,
  there&#39;s a nice pair of you, I don&#39;t think. Never mind him,
  ducky dear&#8212;don&#39;t you fret. We are as good as them any day.
  Let&#39;s go up stairs, there&#39;s a bless-ed. Call the
  <i>garsoon</i>.&quot;</p>

  <p>Poor Michael knew not what step to take, what language to employ,
  in order to effect his purpose. He could not think of quitting Paris,
  leaving his partner behind him, open to the seductions of the city,
  and eager to avail himself of every license and indulgence. He had
  hoped to frighten him into better behaviour, and perhaps he would
  have succeeded but for the presence of the lady, whose appearance and
  demeanour, more than any thing else, confounded and annoyed him. He
  remained silent for a few seconds, and then, in a quieter tone, he
  asked Brammel when he really thought of getting back to business.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, very soon,&quot; replied the youth, himself reduced to
  civility by Michael&#39;s more peaceful aspect; &quot;and I should
  have been back before now, if I hadn&#39;t been bothered about a lot
  of things. If you hadn&#39;t come in blustering, I should have told
  you so. I shall be all right enough, don&#39;t you fear, when I get
  home. I promised father I should settle, and so I mean&#8212;but a
  wedding trip is a wedding trip, and ladies mustn&#39;t be
  baulked.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; answered Allcraft, grateful for as much
  as this&#8212;&quot;then, when do you think of reaching
  home?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, before you, I&#39;ll wager! We haven&#39;t got much more
  to see. We went to the Jordan de Plants yesterday. We are going to
  the Pantheon to-morrow. We shall soon get done. Make your mind
  easy.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;As soon as you have visited these places, I am to
  understand, then, that you return to business?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Exactly so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And may I venture to intreat you to abstain from visiting
  the gambling-house again?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry yourself! If you had only spoken at
  first like a gentleman, I should have promised you without being
  asked.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Both you and Mrs Brammel must see, I am sure, the very great
  propriety of avoiding all such scenes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Mary Anne; and then repeating her
  husband&#39;s words, &quot;but if you had only spoken at first like a
  gentleman!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps I was too hasty, madam. It is a fault that I have.
  We shall understand one another much better for the future. You will
  be at home in about&#8212;ten days we&#39;ll say, from the present
  time, at latest.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t fix days, I never could bear it! We shall be
  all right. Will you stay breakfast?&quot;</p>

  <p>Michael excused himself, and, having done all that was permitted
  him, departed. With a sad spirit he encountered his lady, and with
  gloomy forebodings his mind was filled that day. Augustus Brammel was
  destined to be his thorn, his trial, and his punishment. He could see
  it already. His house, otherwise so stable, so promising, and so
  prosperous, would receive a mortal blow from this one threatening
  point. It must be warded off. The hurtful limb must by degrees be got
  away. He must, from this time forward, engage himself in its removal.
  It was, after all, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_730" id=
  "Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span> consolation to have met the pair, and
  to have succeeded so far in frightening them home again, as he fully
  believed he had. For a time at least, he conceived that Brammel was
  still safe. This conviction gave him courage, and carried him on his
  road to Lyons, with a heart not altogether ill at ease, and without
  good hope. In the meanwhile Mrs Brammel had inveighed, in the most
  unmeasured terms, against the insolent behaviour of Mr Allcraft, the
  pride and arrogance of his wife, whom she had never seen&#8212;the
  marked, unpardonable insult she had offered her in not accompanying
  Allcraft on his visit; and had succeeded, in short, in effectually
  driving from her husband&#39;s mind the little good effect which had
  been produced by the partner&#39;s just remonstrance. Ignorant and
  vulgar as she was, the woman had unbounded influence and power. How
  much, may be guessed from the fact, that before Michael Allcraft was
  ten miles on his journey to Lyons, she had prevailed upon her husband
  to draw his first cheque upon his house to the tune of Â£500, and to
  prolong their holiday by visiting in succession the south of France,
  Switzerland, and Italy. The fool, after an inane resistance,
  consented; his cheque was converted to money&#8212;the horses were
  ordered&#8212;and on they dashed.</p>

  <h3><a name="THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_IV" id=
  "THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

  <h3>A SPECULATION.</h3>

  <p>&quot;When the cat is away, the mice begin to play.&quot; It is an
  old and a true saying, and Michael, had he been an experienced
  mouser, would have remembered it to his advantage, when he thought of
  leaving the banking-house to the tender mercies of his colleagues.
  His confidence in Planner was very great, and I will not say
  undeserved; still some account should have been taken of his previous
  habits, and the positive abiding infirmity of human nature. It was
  surely dangerous to surround a man so fickle, and so easily led by
  the delusions of his sanguine spirit, with every temptation to walk
  astray, and to remove every check that had hitherto kept down the
  capricious movements of his most unsteady will. The daily, almost
  hourly presence of Allcraft, his vigorous and immediate
  superintendence of affairs, had subdued the speculative soul of
  Planner, and rendered him a useful man of business. He was, in truth,
  a good accountant, ardent in his pursuits, a faithful friend, an
  honest man. With the needful restraints upon him, he proved, as
  Allcraft had believed he would, a warm and active partisan. Had those
  restraints been continued for any time&#8212;had he been trained, and
  so reconciled and accustomed to his yoke, all might have prospered
  and been well with him. His own happiness might have been secured,
  and the hopes of his friend and patron would not have been blasted.
  It was the misfortune of Allcraft, with all his long-sightedness, not
  to see far enough. He was to blame, deeply to blame, for the
  desertion of a man whom he knew to be at the mercy of his own wayward
  spirit, and utterly incapable of self-defence. Yet, called abroad,
  what could he do? It is the fate of cunning, as it is of suspicion
  and other mortal weaknesses, to fall into toils of its own weaving.
  Michael too soon was called to pay the penalty. Allcraft had been in
  France a fortnight, when Planner received a fatal visit at the bank
  from a very old friend and stanch ally&#8212;a creature as excitable
  and sanguine as himself, as full of projects, and as unsuccessful.
  They had known each other in the early and distant days of their
  prosperity&#8212;they had grown poor together&#8212;they were united
  by the uniformity of their fortunes as by the similarity of their
  natures. They had both for years regarded themselves as the
  persecuted and injured of society&#8212;and both were satisfied of
  their ability to achieve miracles, time and the occasion serving. It
  is not for speculative spirits to be disheartened by failure, but
  rather to be encouraged by ill success to fresh extravagance, else
  had the poor result of all their schemes long since extinguished the
  fire at work within them. Not one of their <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span>
  innumerable plans had shown a gleam, a spark, of reality and life.
  One morning, about five years before the present visit, Mr William
  Wedge rose from bed with the pleasing notion that he would ruin all
  the public gaming-houses in the world. He had suddenly discovered the
  secret of their success&#8212;the cause of their enormous
  gains&#8212;and had arranged, with minutest care and skill, a
  systematic course of play to bring against them. It was with
  difficulty that he contained himself until he mentioned his good
  fortune to his friend. They met time after time in secret, grew
  fearfully mysterious&#8212;closed their windows in the open
  day&#8212;played cards from morning till night, and sometimes through
  the night&#8212;with no other eye upon them than the very feeble,
  faint-glimmering one of their farthing rushlight;&#8212;they carried
  directions in their pocket&#8212;learnt them off&#8212;repeated them
  until they grew familiar as their oaths, and more familiar than their
  prayers. To realize between them a standing capital of five pounds, a
  sum essential to their operations, they pawned all the available
  clothing they possessed; and on the very night that they obtained the
  cash, they sallied forth to carry devastation and affright throughout
  the camps of innocent and unsuspecting blacklegs. As might be
  expected, it took about as many minutes as they had pounds to effect
  the ruin of the adventurers. Did they despond? Not they; a flaw
  existed in their calculations. They looked for it with care, and were
  torn from their employment only by the exigencies of the time, and
  the pressing demands of nature for immediate bread. Mr Wedge had from
  this period struggled on, living as he knew how, and nobody could
  tell, until Planner&#39;s unexpected good fortune and ascent provided
  him with an allowance and a quiet mind to follow out his views. Since
  Planner&#39;s introduction into the bank, he had behaved faithfully
  and well to his ancient crony; in addition to a pension, paid weekly
  and in advance, he gave him a right of entrÃ©e to his rooms after the
  hours of business, a certain supper three times a-week, and an
  uncertain quantity of brandy and water on the same occasions. One
  stipulation only he deemed necessary for his protection. He had given
  his word to Allcraft to avoid all trading unconnected with the
  bank&#8212;to abstain from speculation. Weak at the best of times, he
  knew himself to be literally helpless with the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of
  a hopeful project before his eyes; and he made a condition of
  Wedge&#39;s visits&#8212;his silence upon matters of business,
  private or public. It was a wise resolution, nobly formed, and for a
  season well carried out. Wedge promised to be cautious, and did not
  break his word. Peace of mind, a regular diet, and a full stomach,
  were such extraordinary circumstances in the daily doings of the
  latter, that the restraint upon his tongue was, in the first month or
  two of the new excitement, scarcely felt as an inconvenience. Planner
  himself, with the eye of Allcraft upon him, kept his natural
  inclination safely in the rear of <i>his</i> promise, and so the days
  and nights passed pleasantly. On the evening above alluded
  to&#8212;that is to say, just a fortnight after Michael&#39;s
  departure&#8212;Wedge came as usual for his supper, grog, and
  conversation. The clock had just struck eleven&#8212;the friends were
  sitting together, their feet upon the fender, their hands upon their
  tumblers. As was usual with them, they discussed the doings of the
  nation, and called in question the proceedings of the existing
  government. One subject after another was dismissed&#8212;politics,
  law, love, and religion&#8212;they abused every thing, and agreed
  marvellously. It was getting very near midnight, the hour at which,
  it is said, devils are let loose upon earth for mischief&#8212;when a
  rascally little imp crawled up to Planner&#39;s ear, and put it into
  his head to talk about the amusements of the poor, and their effects
  upon the rising generation.</p>

  <p>&quot;They will be sorry for it, Wedge&#8212;mark my words. All
  this stabbing and killing comes from too much work and no play.
  Jack&#39;s at his tools for ever&#8212;gets a dull boy&#8212;and then
  stabs and cuts about him for the sake of getting lively. Government
  should have playgrounds in every parish. They would save the expense
  in the rapid diminution of the standing army. I wrote a letter once
  to the prime minister&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>Wedge sighed.</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you mean by that, Wedge? Ah, quite right&#8212;I
  see! You are a good fellow, Wedge. You have kept the compact. I
  won&#39;t be the first to break it. Let us change the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
  subject. I burnt all my letters and papers the day I got here. What
  was the good of keeping them? This is an ungrateful country,
  Wedge!&quot;</p>

  <p>Wedge sipped his grog, and sighed again.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is the matter, boy?&quot; enquired his patron.
  &quot;Speak your mind&#8212;relieve your heart.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, I won&#39;t, Planner&#8212;I won&#39;t be the first. You
  sha&#39;n&#39;t say it is me. I don&#39;t mean to be blamed,
  that&#39;s a fact&#8212;but if I dared, oh, that&#39;s all!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it any thing very good?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Good! Good, did you say? Well, an agreement&#39;s an
  agreement, Planner. It isn&#39;t for me to introduce the subject; but
  I could tell you something, if we were differently situated, that
  would be a fortune to you. Ah, Planner, I sha&#39;n&#39;t be a burden
  upon you long! I have hit upon a thing at last&#8212;I am a made
  man!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Now I tell you what, Wedge,&quot; said Planner, pulling out
  his watch, and looking very serious, &quot;we&#39;ll have just five
  minutes&#39; private conversation on this matter, and then have done
  with it. Only five minutes, mind you, by the watch. If we mutually
  agree to lay aside our compact for a minute or so, there&#39;s no
  great harm done, provided it isn&#39;t made a precedent. I should
  like to see you set a-going, Wedge. You may open your mind to me, and
  be sure of good advice. It&#39;s now seven minutes to twelve. Till
  twelve, Wedge, you are at liberty to talk on business.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What were you saying just now about amusements, Planner? Do
  you recollect.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have thought about it for the last six months. We have
  formed a company.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A company!&quot;</p>

  <p>Wedge was as full of mystery as an Oxford tractman. He rose on
  tiptoe from his chair, proceeded to the passage, listened on the
  stairs, returned as carefully, closed the door, resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>&quot;A company!&quot; repeated Planner.</p>

  <p>&quot;Such an undertaking!&quot; proceeded the ungagged and
  self-deluded Wedge. &quot;It&#39;s the finest thing that has been
  thought of for these hundred years. I <i>am</i> surprised it never
  once occurred to you. Your mind, Planner, should have grasped
  it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What can it be?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We mean to call it the <i>Pantamorphica</i>, because it
  takes all shapes. We are in treaty now for a hundred acres of land
  within three miles of London. We are to have a
  race-course&#8212;public gardens with fountains and
  promenades&#8212;a gymnasium for callisthenic and other
  exercises&#8212;boating&#8212;a menagerie&#8212;a
  library&#8212;lecture-rooms&#8212;conservatories&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;By Jove, I see!&quot; ejaculated Planner.
  &quot;Capital!&#8212;a universal playground; trust me, I have thought
  of it before. Go on.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;These are for the daylight. At night we have a
  concert-room&#8212;a theatre&#8212;saloons for dancing&#8212;halls
  for refreshment&#8212;museums for <i>converzatione</i>. In the centre
  of the public walks we have a synagogue, a church, and chapel for
  Sabbath visitors. Then we shall have
  aviaries&#8212;apiaries&#8212;caves&#8212;alpine
  scenery&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Upon my soul, Wedge, it&#39;s a grand conception!&quot;
  There was a large clock at the bottom of the stairs which struck
  twelve, loud enough to awake the sleeping household; but, strange to
  say, neither Planner nor his friend heard a single chime. &quot;Who
  are your men?&quot; continued Planner.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, first-rate men! Three of the first London bankers, two
  of the chief architects, the richest capitalist in
  England&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;What, have you got them all?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, but we mean to ask them to take shares, and to take part
  in the direction. They&#39;ll jump, sir, at the offer.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, that they will! What&#39;s your capital?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Half a million&#8212;five thousand shares of a hundred each.
  It&#39;s nothing at all!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, nothing really. What is your appointment?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am secretary; and I am to have a bonus of five thousand
  pounds when the thing is fairly started.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You well deserve it, Wedge. Ah, sir, I have dreamt of this
  before!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;have you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It must do, Wedge. It can&#39;t help itself. People will be
  amused&#8212;people will pay for it. Amuse them from morning till
  night&#8212;change the scene every hour of the day&#8212;vary the
  pleasures. Wedge, you are a national benefactor.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is past twelve,&quot; said Wedge hesitatingly, looking at
  the watch.</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;is it?&quot; asked Planner, looking at it likewise.
  &quot;There must be some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_733" id=
  "Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span> mistake. Have you heard the clock
  strike?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nor I; my watch is out of order&#8212;too fast a great deal.
  Let us go by the big clock. Now, when that strikes twelve, Wedge, you
  shall go home, and I&#39;ll to bed&#8212;an understanding is an
  understanding, Wedge.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And so you like it, Planner&#8212;eh?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Like it, sir&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>It was exactly a quarter to four o&#39;clock when Planner put out
  his bedroom candle, and Wedge tucked himself up as well as he could
  on the hard horsehair sofa in Planner&#39;s sitting-room. Having
  enlarged upon the <i>Pantamorphica</i> speculation until the above
  unreasonable hour, it was not deemed respectable for Mr Wedge to quit
  the banking-house on the dark side of sunrise. The latter gentleman
  had worked himself up to such a pitch of excitement in blowing out
  his bubble, that it was very nearly six o&#39;clock before he could
  be pronounced in a condition to say his prayers like a rational
  being, and go to sleep. As for Planner, he had heard too much to be
  quiet. He tossed his head on his pillow&#8212;turned from side to
  side&#8212;sat up and lay down again at intervals, until the break of
  day. He had resolved to take an active interest in this glorious
  undertaking. Nothing should hinder him. Its returns must necessarily
  be immense. He had promised Allcraft to enter into no business
  foreign to the banking-house. But what of that? He should be without
  an excuse for his blindness if he closed his eyes to the advantages
  which stared him in the face. He would not be selfish. Allcraft
  should share in the reward. He, who had acted so friendly a part to
  him, should be repaid for his noble conduct. &quot;Share and share
  alike,&quot; should be his motto. And he would not hesitate or
  postpone his intentions. He would look thoroughly into the affair at
  once, and go boldly forward. It should be his pleasure and his pride
  to greet and surprise his partner with the unexpected news the
  instant he returned. Sweet are the visions of life, sleeping or
  waking. It is the substance and the truth that pass like iron to the
  soul, and kill it. Poor Planner!</p>

  <h3><a name="THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_V" id=
  "THE_BANKING-HOUSE_CHAP_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

  <h3>A LANDED PROPRIETOR.</h3>

  <p>After Michael had spent a month in France, he discovered that he
  must still travel on, and still sacrifice time and exertion, if he
  hoped to bring his unfortunate parent&#39;s affairs to a satisfactory
  issue. Many things had happened since his arrival to give him great
  pain and annoyance. In the first place, he had learned, with a
  sickening heart, that the private debts of his father considerably
  exceeded in amount those which had appeared in the testamentary
  memorandum. He had seen with his own eyes his father&#39;s
  acknowledgment of liabilities, the existence of which was thus
  revealed to him for the first time. In his immediate and violent
  disgust, he burned to expose his parent&#39;s cupidity and
  dishonesty, and to rid himself of the burden which he had voluntarily
  taken as his own; but pride, shame, and other low incentives, came
  between him and the fulfilment of a rash resolution, and he had
  nothing to do but to look his difficulty fully and bravely in the
  face. In addition to this trial, he found it necessary to proceed
  without delay as far eastward as Vienna; for thither his chief
  creditor had taken himself on urgent business, which threatened to
  detain him on the spot until the following year. Nor was this all; a
  Lyonese merchant, who held old Allcraft&#39;s note of hand for a
  considerable sum, advanced under assurances of early payment, had
  grown obstinate and restive with disappointment and anxiety. He
  insisted upon the instant discharge of his claim, and refused to give
  another hour&#39;s grace. To rid himself of this plague, Michael had
  not hesitated to draw upon his house for a sum somewhat greater than
  five thousand pounds. The act had not been committed without some
  distress of mind&#8212;some murmurings of conscience; but the
  necessity was great&#8212;the compulsion not to be avoided. To put an
  end to all further and importunate demands, he posted into Austria
  fast as he could be conveyed. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_734" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</a></span> The chief creditor was
  destined to be Michael&#39;s chief misery. He was an obdurate,
  unyielding man, and, after days of negotiation, would finally listen
  to nothing but the chink of the gold that was due to him. And how
  much that was, Michael dared not trust himself to think. Now, what
  was to be done? To draw again upon the bank&#8212;to become himself,
  to his partners, an example of recklessness and extravagance, was out
  of the question. He had but one course before him, and it was one
  which he had solemnly vowed never to adopt. To beg a loan from his
  wife so early in the morning of their union, seemed a thing
  impossible&#8212;at least it seemed so in the outset, when the
  thought first blushed upon him, and there remained a chance, a hope,
  of escaping from the miserable alternative. But as the creditor got
  clamorous, and every prospect of satisfying his demand&#8212;every
  means save one&#8212;grew dim, and shadowy, and blank, the
  wrongfulness, the impropriety of making an appeal to her, whose heart
  was willing as her hand was able to release him from despair, became
  less evident, and by degrees not evident at all. It would have been
  well for Allcraft, and for Margaret too, had the latter resisted his
  demand, or opposed it with one kind word of remonstrance. Michael was
  prepared for this, and the gentlest opposition would have saved them
  both. But what did Margaret possess, which she wished not to share
  with him who was her idol&#8212;dearer to her than her life&#8212;the
  joy and light of life! He hinted his request; she hardly suffered him
  to hint it. She placed her substance at his command, and bade him use
  it. Like a guilty man&#8212;one guilty of his first but heavy
  fault&#8212;blushing and faltering, Allcraft thanked his Margaret for
  the loan, promised speedy payment, and vowed that he would beg no
  more. Fond Margaret! she kissed the vow away, and bade him clear his
  brow, smile, and be happy. It was a woman&#39;s part, who loves not
  wisely, but too well. The day that gave him the means of satisfying
  the claims of one great creditor, bound Allcraft more seriously to
  another; but he rejoiced at his success, which brought him temporary
  ease, and he congratulated himself upon his deliverance from failure
  and exposure. There was little to do. The lady&#39;s broker was
  written to; the legal adviser of the gentleman, at Michael&#39;s own
  request, prepared an instrument to secure repayment of the loan; the
  money came&#8212;the debts of Allcraft senior to the last farthing
  were discharged, and scarcely discharged before Michael, eager and
  anxious to be at home, quitted Vienna, ready to travel by night and
  day, and longing to feel his footing safely in the banking-house
  again.</p>

  <p>It is now proper to state, that on the very day that Michael&#39;s
  draft of five thousand pounds applied for honourable reception at the
  counter of his most respectable establishment, by a curious
  coincidence another demand for double that amount appeared there
  likewise; not in the shape of cheque or written order, but in that of
  a request, personal and oral, proceeding from the proud and high-born
  lips of Walter Bellamy, Esquire, lord of the manor&#8212;gentleman
  and banker. Mr Bellamy was not the first man, by a great number, who
  has attempted to clothe and conceal real poverty in the stately
  apparel of arrogance and offensive self-sufficiency. He, man of the
  world, knew well enough, that, thus disguised, <i>necessity</i> need
  never fear discovery&#8212;might look and laugh in secret at
  mankind&#8212;might feed and thrive upon its faults and weaknesses.
  How comparatively easy it is to avoid the shoals and rocks of
  life&#8212;to sail smoothly and pleasantly on its waters, when we
  take for our rudder and our guide the world&#39;s great axiom,
  &quot;<span class='smcap'>riches are
  virture</span>&#8212;<span class='smcap'>poverty is
  vice</span>.&quot; &quot;Assume the <i>virtue</i>, if you have it
  not;&quot; assume its shows and appearances, its tricks, its
  offences, and its crimes, rather than confess your nakedness. Be
  liberal and prodigal, if it must be, with the crown you need to pay
  your necessary lodging; adorn with velvet and with silk the body that
  grows sick for lack of wholesome food; bribe, beyond their
  expectation, the pampered things in livery that stand between you and
  the glory you aspire to&#8212;bribe them, though to part with money
  is to lose your meal. Upon this broad principle it was, that Walter
  Bellamy existed&#8212;in virtue of it he held lands, and by its means
  he had become a partner in the bank, an active one, as very soon he
  proved himself to be. His property was estimated by shrewd
  calculators at a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_735" id=
  "Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span> hundred thousand pounds&#8212;that, at
  the very least. And Bellamy chuckled at his fireside&#8212;no one
  being by&#8212;at the universal gullibility of man. A hundred
  thousand pounds! Why, he could not&#8212;at any one period during the
  last twenty years, command as many farthings. What right had
  strangers to calculate for him? What right had Allcraft to depend
  upon such calculations? We may well ask the question, since Mr
  Bellamy did so, when he endeavoured, as the worst of us will do, to
  justify bad conduct to an unfaithful conscience. Why, what was he? a
  simple <i>locum tenens</i> of a dozen mortgagees, who had advanced
  upon the estate a great deal more money than it would ever realize,
  if forced to sale&#8212;a haughty, overbearing man, (though very
  benevolent to postboys and other serving men,) a magistrate, and a
  great disciplinarian. This was the amount of his pretensions, and yet
  men worshipped him. It was surely not the fault of Mr Bellamy, but
  rather his good fortune; and if he chose to make the most of it, he
  was a wise and prudent personage. When it is borne in mind that the
  possessions of Mr Bellamy were involved beyond their actual
  worth&#8212;that for some time he had lived in a perpetual dread of
  exposure and utter ruin&#8212;that for years he had looked abroad for
  some kind friend, who, if not altogether willing, might still be
  prevailed upon to release him from his difficulties&#8212;it will be
  easy to understand his very great desire to confer on Michael
  Allcraft all the advantages of his own position and high
  character.</p>

  <p>The part which Bellamy had taken in the business of the house, was
  very inconsiderable until Michael&#39;s departure. Up to that time,
  he came to the bank in his carriage with much ceremony&#8212;spoke to
  the dependents there with becoming <i>hauteur</i>, and took his
  leave, on all occasions, as a rich man should, with abundant fuss,
  scarcely troubling himself with the proceedings of the day. &quot;He
  had,&quot; he was always repeating the words, &quot;he had the
  greatest confidence in Allcraft. It was unbounded. He felt that he
  could trust to him entirely and unreservedly.&quot; Gratefully did
  such expressions fall upon the flattered ear of Michael, applauding
  himself ever upon his victory&#8212;upon the acquisition of such a
  man. Of what service he would be to him in his well-laid plans! Of
  what use was his name already&#8212;and how much more serviceable
  than all would be the noble sum of money which he had <i>promised</i>
  to bring into the bank at the close of the year! Michael, in his
  moments of chivalry, standing in the presence of Bellamy, looked upon
  him almost with an eye of pity and self-reproach. Whilst he himself
  could only plead guilty to a most refined and cunning policy, his
  innocent partner was but too full of trust; too simple and too
  unsuspecting. Somebody remarks, that God reserves unto himself that
  horrid sight&#8212;a naked, human heart. Had Allcraft and Bellamy,
  during one of their early interviews, suddenly stripped, and favoured
  each other with reciprocal glances&#8212;one or both would have been
  slightly startled by the unexpected exhibition. Planner had always
  looked upon Mr Bellamy as a very great man indeed&#8212;had
  contemplated him with that exact admixture of awe and admiration,
  that was pleasing and acceptable to the subject of it. Mr Bellamy, in
  his turn, conducted himself towards the schemer with much cordiality
  and kindness. Proud men never unbend until their supremacy is
  acknowledged through your servility. Your submission turns their gall
  to honey&#8212;converts their vinegar to milk&#8212;to the very cream
  of human complaisance. Mr Bellamy acted his part in this respect, as
  in every other&#8212;well; a tiger to such as would not cringe, he
  could become a playful lamb to all who were content to fawn. Planner
  and he were on the best possible terms. Looking into what is called
  the nature of things, we shall think it very natural on the part of
  Mr Bellamy, when he found himself so agreeably situated in regard to
  the circulating medium, if he took an early opportunity to help
  himself of the abundance by which he was surrounded. The truth is,
  that some time before the visit of Allcraft to the Continent, he had
  entertained a very serious intention of drawing out of the concern
  the anticipatory profits of a few years, in order to relieve himself
  and fine estate from certain engagements which pressed inconveniently
  on both&#8212;but his object had not, for many reasons, been carried
  into effect. In the first place, a moderate <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span> degree
  of actual shame withheld him&#8212;and again, he had begged for time
  from his creditor, and obtained it. Allcraft absent, the sense of
  shame diminished; before he could return to England, the grateful
  respite was at an end. It was a fine bright morning when Mr
  Bellamy&#39;s grand carriage drew up in state before the
  banking-house, and the highly respectable proprietor descended from
  it with his accustomed style and dignity. Mr Planner was, at the
  moment, at his desk, very busy with the prospectus of the
  <i>Pantamorphica</i> Association, in which he had just completed some
  very striking additions&#8212;but perceiving his respected colleague,
  he jumped from his seat, and hastened to give him greeting.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t let me disturb you, my dear friend,&quot; said the
  gracious Mr Bellamy. &quot;I beg you&#39;ll prosecute your
  labours.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t mention it, I pray&#8212;so like you, Mr
  Bellamy&#8212;always considerate and kind.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Busy, Mr Planner&#8212;eh?&#8212;a deal to do now in the
  absence of our good friend?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Enough, enough sir, I assure you&#8212;but business, sir, is
  pleasure to the active mind.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very true&#8212;we feel your worth, sir&#8212;the house
  acknowledges your ability, Mr Planner.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dear Mr Bellamy&#8212;you are very flattering.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;not at all. Have you any engagement, Mr Planner,
  for this evening? Can you find time to dine with us at the Hall? I am
  positively angry with you for your repeated excuses.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I shall be too proud, sir&#8212;business
  hitherto&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay&#8212;ay&#8212;but, my good sir, we must not sacrifice
  ourselves to business. A little recreation is absolutely
  necessary.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So it is, sir&#8212;so it is&#8212;and you, sir, with your
  splendid fortune and superior taste&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, ah&#8212;<i>apropos</i>! have you heard from Mr Allcraft
  lately?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;This morning, sir.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;When does he return, pray?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In about a week from this. He writes he leaves Vienna this
  very day.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dear me, how very inconvenient, how very vexing!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What is it, may I ask, sir?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, a trifle, Mr Planner. Dear me&#8212;dear me&#8212;it is
  annoying too!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it nothing that we can do, sir? Any thing the bank can
  offer?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why&#8212;my dear sir&#8212;it is rather awkward, certainly.
  I have engaged to complete a purchase, and it must be done to-morrow.
  What cash have we in the house? There can be no impropriety in
  withdrawing a few thousand pounds for a short time. What do you
  think&#8212;Mr Allcraft being away?&quot;</p>

  <p>Now, Planner himself, during the last few days, had been very busy
  with the cash-box, in order to meet the expenses of certain
  preliminaries essential to the success of the infant
  <i>Pantamorphica</i>&#8212;into which speculation, by the way, he had
  entered heart and soul&#8212;and it was quite a relief and a joy to
  him to find his partner turning his attention to the same quarter; so
  true it is, that no pleasure is so sweet to a sinner, as the
  wickedness and companionship of a brother criminal.</p>

  <p>&quot;Impropriety, sir!&quot; exclaimed the schemer.
  &quot;Certainly not. Draw your cheque, sir. If we have not the money
  here, we have a heavy purse in London&#8212;and I beg you will
  command it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You think, then, that until our friend&#39;s
  return&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am perfectly satisfied, Mr Bellamy,&quot; said Planner,
  with an emphasis on every word, as men will sometimes use, feeling
  and believing all that they assert. &quot;I am thoroughly convinced
  that nothing would give Mr Allcraft greater pain than to know you had
  needed a temporary loan, and had not availed yourself of every
  opportunity that the bank affords you. I entreat you not to hesitate
  one instant. How much may you require?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, my dear sir&#8212;you will dine with us this evening.
  We will talk the matter over. Don&#39;t be late. Upon consideration,
  it may be quite as well, perhaps, to draw upon the bank.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Much better, sir, I am sure, in every way. Will you walk
  into the private room? You&#39;ll find pen, ink, and paper there. We
  can accommodate you, sir&#8212;no doubt.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank you, Mr Planner, thank you.&quot;</p>

  <p>How very few of the numerous clients of Messrs Allcraft, Bellamy,
  Brammel, and Planner, in their worst dreams that night, dreamt of the
  havoc which was making with their beloved and hard-earned cash!</p>

  <h2><a name="COLLEGE_THEATRICALS" id=
  "COLLEGE_THEATRICALS"></a>COLLEGE THEATRICALS.</h2>

  <p>It wanted but two or three weeks to the Christmas vacation, and
  we&#8212;the worshipful society of under-graduates of &#8212;&#8212;
  College, Oxford&#8212;were beginning to get tired of the eternal
  round of supper parties which usually marked the close of our
  winter&#39;s campaign, and ready to hail with delight any proposition
  that had the charm of novelty. A three weeks&#39; frost had
  effectually stopped the hunting; all the best tandem leaders were
  completely screwed; the freshmen had been &quot;larked&quot; till
  they were grown as cunning as magpies; and the Dean had set up a
  divinity lecture at two o&#39;clock, and published a stringent
  proclamation against rows in the Quad. It was, in short, in a
  particularly uninteresting state of things, with the snow falling
  lazily upon the grey roofs and silent quadrangle, that some half
  dozen of us had congregated in Bob Thornhill&#39;s rooms, to get over
  the time between lunch and dinner with as little trouble to our
  mental and corporal faculties as possible. Those among us who had
  been for the last three months promising to themselves to begin to
  read &quot;next week,&quot; had now put off that too easy creditor,
  conscience, till &quot;next term.&quot; One alone had settled his
  engagements of that nature, or, in the language of his
  &quot;<i>Testamur</i>&quot;&#8212;the prettiest bit of Latin, he
  declared, that he ever saw&#8212;&quot;<i>satisfecit
  examinatoribus</i>.&quot; Unquestionably, in his case, the examiners
  must have had the rare virtue of being very easily satisfied. In
  fact, Mr Savile&#39;s discharge of his educational engagements was
  rather a sort of &quot;whitewashing&quot; than a payment in full. His
  passing was what is technically called a &quot;shave,&quot; a
  metaphor alluding to that intellectual density which finds it
  difficult to squeeze through the narrow portal which admits to the
  privileges of a Bachelor of Arts. As Mr S. himself, being a sporting
  man, described it, it was &quot;a very close run indeed;&quot; not
  that he considered that circumstance to derogate, in any way, from
  his victory; he was rather inclined to consider, that, having shown
  the field of examiners capital sport, and fairly got away from them
  in the end without the loss of his brush, his examination had been
  one of the very best runs of the season. In virtue whereof he was now
  mounted on the arm of an easy-chair, with a long <i>chibouque</i>,
  which became the gravity of an incipient bachelor better than a
  cigar, and took upon himself to give Thornhill (who was really a
  clever fellow, and professing to be reading for a first) some advice
  as to his conducting himself when his examination should arrive.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, Thornhill, old boy, I&#39;ll give
  you a wrinkle; it doesn&#39;t always answer to let out all you know
  at an examination. That sly old varmint, West of Magdalen, asked me
  who Hannibal was. &#39;Aha!&#39;&#8212;said I to
  myself&#8212;&#39;that&#39;s your line of country, is it? You want to
  walk me straight into those botheration Punic Wars, it&#39;s no go,
  though; I sha&#39;n&#39;t break cover in that direction.&#39; So I
  was mute. &#39;Can&#39;t you tell me something about Hannibal?&#39;
  says old West again. &#39;I can,&#39; thinks I, &#39;but I
  won&#39;t.&#39; He was regularly flabbergasted; I spoilt his beat
  entirely, don&#39;t you see? so he looked as black as thunder, and
  tried it on in a fresh place. If I had been fool enough to let him
  dodge me in those Punic Wars, I could have been run into in no time.
  Depend upon it, there&#39;s nothing like a judicious ignorance
  occasionally.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Thornhill, &quot;&#39;when ignorance is
  bliss,&#39; (<i>i. e.</i> when it gets through the schools,) &#39;tis
  folly to be wise.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! that&#39;s Shakspeare says that, isn&#39;t it? I wish
  one could take up Shakspeare for a class! I&#39;m devilish fond of
  Shakspeare. We used to act Shakspeare at a private school I was
  at.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;By Jove!&quot; said somebody from behind a cloud of
  smoke&#8212;whose the brilliant idea was, was afterwards matter of
  dispute&#8212;&quot;why couldn&#39;t we get up a play?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! why not? why not? Capital!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s such a horrid bore learning one&#39;s part,&quot;
  lisped the elegant Horace Leicester, half awake on the sofa.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, stuff!&quot; said Savile, &quot;it&#39;s the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg
  738]</a></span> very thing to keep us alive! We could make a capital
  theatre out of the hall; don&#39;t you think the little vice
  principal would give us leave?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You had better ask for the chapel at once. Why, don&#39;t
  you know, my dear fellow, the college hall, in the opinion of the
  dean and the vice, is held rather more sacred of the two? Newcome,
  poor devil, attempted to cut a joke at the high table one of the
  times he dined there after he was elected, and he told me that they
  all stared at him as if he had insulted them; and the vice (in
  confidence) explained to him that such &#39;levity&#39; was treason
  against the &#39;<i>reverentia loci</i>!&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, I remember when that old villain Solomon, the porter,
  fined me ten shillings for walking in there with spurs one day when I
  was late for dinner; he said the dean always took off his cap when he
  went in there by himself, and threatened to turn off old Higgs, when
  he had been scout forty years, because he heard him whistling one day
  while he was sweeping it out! Well,&quot; continued Savile, &quot;you
  shall have my rooms; I sha&#39;n&#39;t trouble them much now. I am
  going to pack all my books down to old Wise&#39;s next week, to turn
  them into ready <i>tin</i>; so you may turn the study into a
  carpenter&#39;s shop, if you like. Oh, it can be managed
  famously!&quot;</p>

  <p>So, after a few <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>, it was finally
  settled that Mr Savile&#39;s rooms should become the Theatre Royal,
  &#8212;&#8212; College; and I was honoured with the responsible
  office of stage-manager. What the play was to be was a more difficult
  point to settle. Savile proposed <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and
  volunteered for the hero; but it passed the united strength of the
  company to get up a decent <i>Juliet</i>. <i>Richard the Third</i>
  was suggested; we had &quot;six <i>Richards</i> in the field&quot; at
  once. We soon gave up the heroics, and decided on comedy; for, since
  our audience would be sure to laugh, we should at least have a chance
  of getting the laugh in the right place. So, after long discussion,
  we fixed on <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>. There were a good many
  reasons for this selection. First, it was a piece possessing that
  grand desideratum in all amateur performances, that there were
  several parts in it of equal calibre, and none which implied decided
  superiority of talent in its representative. Secondly, there was not
  much <i>love</i> in it; a material point where, as an Irishman might
  say, all the ladies were gentlemen. Thirdly, the scenery, dresses,
  properties, and decorations, were of the very simplest description:
  it was easily &quot;put upon the stage.&quot; We found little
  difficulty in casting the male characters; old Mrs Hardcastle, not
  requiring any great share of personal attractions, and being
  considered a part that would tell, soon found a representative; but
  when we came to the &quot;donnas&quot;&#8212;<i>prima</i> and
  <i>secunda</i>&#8212;then it was that the manager&#39;s troubles
  began. It was really necessary, to ensure the most moderate degree of
  success to the comedy, that Miss Hardcastle should have at least a
  lady-like deportment. The public voice, first in whispers, then
  audibly, at last vociferously, called upon Leicester. Slightly
  formed, handsome, clever and accomplished, with naturally graceful
  manners, and a fair share of vanity and affectation, there was no
  doubt of his making a respectable heroine if he would consent to be
  made love to. In vain did he protest against the petticoats, and urge
  with affecting earnestness the claims of the whiskers which for the
  last six months he had so diligently been cultivating; the chorus of
  entreaty and expostulation had its effect, aided by a well-timed
  compliment to the aristocratically small hand and foot, of which
  Horace was pardonably vain. Shaving was pronounced indispensable to
  the due growth of the whiskers; and the importance of the character,
  and the point of the situations, so strongly dwelt upon, that he
  became gradually reconciled to his fate, and began seriously to
  discuss the question whether Miss Hardcastle should wear her hair in
  curls or bands. A freshman of seventeen, who had no pretensions in
  the way of whiskers, and who was too happy to be admitted on any
  terms to a share in such a &quot;fast idea&quot; as the getting up a
  play, was to be the Miss Neville; and before the hall bell rang for
  dinner, an order had been despatched for a dozen acting copies of
  &quot;She Stoops to Conquer.&quot;</p>

  <p>Times have materially changed since Queen Elizabeth&#39;s visit to
  Christ-Church; the University, one of the earliest nurses of the
  infant drama, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_739" id=
  "Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span> has long since turned it out of doors
  for a naughty child; and forbid it, under pain of worse than
  whipping, to come any nearer than Abingdon or Bicester. Taking into
  consideration the style of some of the performances, in which
  under-graduates of some three hundred years ago were the actors, the
  &quot;Oxford Theatre&quot; of those days, if it had more wit in it
  than the present, had somewhat less decency: the ancient
  &quot;moralities&quot; were not over moral, and the
  &quot;mysteries&quot; rather Babylonish. So far we have had no great
  loss. Whether the judicious getting up of a tragedy of Sophocles or
  Ã†schylus, or even a comedy of Terence&#8212;classically
  managed&#8212;as it could be done in Oxford&#8212;and well acted,
  would be more unbecoming the gravity of our collected wisdom, or more
  derogatory to the dignity of our noble &quot;theatre,&quot; than the
  squalling of Italian singers, masculine, feminine, and
  neuter&#8212;is a question which, when I take my M.A., I shall
  certainly propose in convocation. Thus much I am sure of, if a
  classical play-bill were duly announced for the next grand
  commemoration, it would &quot;draw&quot; almost as well as the Duke;
  the dresses might be quite as showy, the action hardly less graceful,
  than those of the odd-looking gentlemen who are dubbed doctors of
  civil law on such occasions; and the speeches of Prometheus, Oedipus,
  or Antigone, would be more intelligible to the learned, and more
  amusing to the ladies, than those Latin essays or the Creweian
  oration.</p>

  <p>However, until I am vice-chancellor, the legitimate drama, Greek,
  Roman, or English, seems little likely to revive in Oxford.
  <i>Our</i> branch of that great family, I confess, bore the
  bar-sinister. The offspring of our theatrical affections was
  unrecognized by college authority. The fellows of &#8212;&#8212;
  would have done any thing but &quot;smile upon its birth.&quot; The
  dean especially would have burked it at once had he suspected its
  existence. Nor was it fostered, like the former Oxford theatricals to
  which we have alluded, by royal patronage; we could not, consistently
  with decorum, request her Majesty to encourage an illegitimate.
  Nevertheless&#8212;spite of its being thus born under the
  rose&#8212;it grew and prospered. Our plan of rehearsal was original.
  We used to adjourn from dinner to the rooms of one or other of the
  company; and there, over our wine and dessert, instead of quizzing
  freshmen and abusing tutors, open each our copy, and, with all due
  emphasis and intonation, go regularly through the scenes of &quot;She
  Stoops to Conquer.&quot; This was all the study we ever gave to our
  parts: and even thus it was difficult to get a muster of all the
  performers, and we had generally to play dummy for some one or more
  of the characters, or &quot;double&quot; them, as the professionals
  call it. The excuses for absenteeism were various. Mrs Hardcastle and
  Tony were gone to Woodstock with a team, and were not to be waited
  for; Diggory had a command to dine with the principal; and once an
  interesting dialogue was cut short by the untoward event of Miss
  Neville&#39;s being &quot;confined&quot;&#8212;in consequence of some
  indiscretion or other&#8212;&quot;to chapel.&quot; It was necessary
  in our management, as much as in Mr Bunn&#39;s or Mr Macready&#39;s,
  to humour the caprices of the stars of the company: but the lesser
  lights, if they became eccentric at all in their orbits, were
  extinguished without mercy. Their place was easily supplied; for the
  moment it became known that a play was in contemplation, there were
  plenty of candidates for dramatic fame, especially among the
  freshmen: and though we mortally offended one or two aspiring
  geniuses by proffering them the vacant situations of Ralph, Roger,
  and Co., in Mr Hardcastle&#39;s household, on condition of having
  their respective blue dress coats turned up with yellow to represent
  the family livery, there were others to whom the being admitted
  behind the scenes, even in these humble characters, was a subject of
  laudable ambition. Nay, unimportant as were some parts in themselves,
  they were quite enough for the histrionic talent of some of our
  friends. Till I became a manager myself, I always used to lose
  patience at the wretched manner in which some of the underlings on
  the stage went through the little they had to say and do: there
  seemed no reason why the &quot;sticks&quot; should be so provokingly
  sticky; and it surprised me that a man who could accost one fluently
  enough at the stage door, should make such a bungle as some of them
  did in a message of some half dozen words &quot;in character.&quot;
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[Pg
  740]</a></span> But when I first became initiated into the mysteries
  of amateur performances, and saw how entirely destitute some men were
  of any notion of natural acting, and how they made a point of
  repeating two lines of familiar dialogue with the tone and manner,
  but without the correctness of a schoolboy going through a
  task&#8212;then it ceased to be any matter of wonder that those to
  whom acting was no joke, but an unhappily earnest mode of getting
  bread, should so often make their performance appear the uneasy
  effort which it is. There was one man in particular, a good-humoured,
  gentlemanly fellow, a favourite with us all; not remarkable for
  talent, but a pleasant companion enough, with plenty of common sense.
  Well, &quot;he would be an actor&quot;&#8212;it was his own fancy to
  have a part, and, as he was &quot;one of us,&quot; we could not well
  refuse him. We gave him an easy one, for he was not vain of his own
  powers, or ambitious of theatrical distinction; so he was to be
  &quot;second fellow&quot;&#8212;one of Tony&#39;s pot-companions. He
  had but two lines to speak; but, from the very first time I heard him
  read them, I set him down as a hopeless case. He read them as if he
  had just learned to spell the words; when he repeated them without
  the book, it was like a clergyman giving out a text. And so it was
  with a good many of the rank and file of the company; we had more
  labour to drill them into something like a natural intonation than to
  learn our own longest speeches twice over. So we made their
  attendance at rehearsals a <i>sine qua non</i>. We dismissed a
  promising &quot;Mat Muggins&quot; because he went to the
  &quot;Union&quot; two nights successively, when he ought to have been
  at &quot;The Three Pigeons.&quot; We superseded a very respectable
  &quot;landlord&quot; (though he had actually been measured for a
  corporation and a pair of calves) for inattention to business. The
  only one of the supernumeraries whom it was at all necessary to
  conciliate, was the gentleman who was to sing the comic song instead
  of Tony, (Savile, the representative of the said Tony, not having
  music in his soul beyond a view-holloa.) He was allowed to go and
  come at our readings <i>ad libitum</i>, upon condition of being very
  careful not to take cold.</p>

  <p>When we had become tolerably perfect in the words of our parts, it
  was deemed expedient to have a &quot;dress
  rehearsal&quot;&#8212;especially for the ladies. It is not very easy
  to move safely&#8212;let alone gracefully&#8212;in petticoats, for
  those who are accustomed to move their legs somewhat more
  independently. And it would not have been civil in Messrs Marlow and
  Hastings to laugh outright at their lady-loves before company, as
  they were sure to do upon their first appearance. A dress rehearsal,
  therefore, was a very necessary precaution. But if it was difficult
  to get the company together at six o&#39;clock under the friendly
  disguise of a wine-party, doubly difficult was it to expect them to
  muster at eleven in the morning. The first day that we fixed for it,
  there came a not very lady-like note, evidently written in bed, from
  Miss Hardcastle, stating, that having been at a supper-party the
  night before, and there partaken of brandy-punch to an extent to
  which she was wholly unaccustomed, it was quite impossible, in the
  present state of her nervous system, for her to make her appearance
  in character at any price. There was no alternative but to put off
  the rehearsal; and that very week occurred a circumstance which was
  very near being the cause of its adjournment <i>sine die</i>.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr Hawthorne,&quot; said the dean to me one morning, when I
  was leaving his rooms, rejoicing in the termination of lecture,
  &quot;I wish to speak with you, if you please.&quot; The dean&#39;s
  communications were seldom of a very pleasing kind, and on this
  particular morning his countenance gave token that he had hit upon
  something more than usually <i>piquant</i>. The rest of the men filed
  out of the door as slowly as they conveniently could, in the hope, I
  suppose, of hearing the dean&#39;s fire open upon me, but he waited
  patiently till my particular friend, Bob Thornhill, had picked up
  carefully, one by one, his miscellaneous collection of note-book,
  pencil, penknife, and other small wares, and had been obliged at
  length to make an unwilling exit; when, seeing the door finally
  closed, he commenced with his usual&#8212;&quot;Have the goodness to
  sit down, sir.&quot;</p>

  <p>Experience had taught me, that it was as well to make
  one&#39;s-self as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_741" id=
  "Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span> comfortable as might be upon these
  occasions; so I took the easy-chair, and tried to look as if I
  thought the dean merely wanted to have a pleasant half-hour&#39;s
  chat. He marched into a little back-room that he called his study,
  and I began to speculate upon the probable subject of our conference.
  Strange! that week had been a more than usually quiet one. No late
  knocking in; no cutting lectures at chapel; positively I began to
  think that, for once, the dean had gone on a wrong scent, and that I
  should repel his accusations with all the dignity of injured
  innocence; or had he sent for me to offer his congratulations on my
  having commenced in the &quot;steady&quot; line, and to ask me to
  breakfast? I was not long to indulge such delusive hopes. Re-enter
  the dean, O. P., as our stage directions would have had it,
  with&#8212;a pair of stays!</p>

  <p>By what confounded ill-luck they had got into his possession I
  could not imagine; but there they were. The dean touched them as if
  he felt their very touch an abomination, threw them on the table, and
  briefly said&#8212;&quot;These, sir, were found in your rooms this
  morning. Can you explain how they came there?&quot;</p>

  <p>True enough, Leicester had been trying on the abominable articles
  in my bedroom, and I had stuffed them into a drawer till wanted. What
  to say was indeed a puzzle. To tell the whole truth would, no doubt,
  have ended the matter at once, and a hearty laugh should I have had
  at the dean&#39;s expense; but it would have put the stopper on
  &quot;She Stoops to Conquer.&quot; It was too ridiculous to look
  grave about; and blacker grew the countenance before me, as, with a
  vain attempt to conceal a smile, I echoed his words, and stammered
  out&#8212;&quot;In my rooms, sir?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, sir, in your bed-room.&quot; He rang the bell.
  &quot;Your servant, Simmons, most properly brought them to
  me.&quot;</p>

  <p>The little rascal! I had been afraid to let him know any thing
  about the theatricals; for I knew perfectly well the dean would hear
  of it in half an hour, for he served him in the double capacity of
  scout and spy. Before the bell had stopped, Dick Simmons made his
  appearance, having evidently been kept at hand. He did look rather
  ashamed of himself, when I asked him, what business he had to search
  my wardrobe?</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh dear, sir! I never did no sich a thing; I was a-making of
  your bed, sir, when I sees the tag of a stay-lace hanging out of your
  topmost drawer, sir&#8212;(&quot;I am a married man, sir,&quot; to
  the dean apologetically, &quot;and I know the tag of a stay-lace,
  sir&quot;)&#8212;and so I took it out, sir; and knowing my duty to
  the college, sir, though I should be very sorry to bring you into
  trouble, Mr Hawthorne, sir&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, yes, Simmons, you did quite right,&quot; said the dean.
  &quot;You are bound to give notice to the college authorities of all
  irregularities, and your situation requires that you should be
  conscientious.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope I am, sir,&quot; said the little rascal; &quot;but
  indeed I am very sorry, Mr Hawthorne, sir&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh! never mind,&quot; said I; &quot;you did right, no doubt.
  I can only say those things are not mine, sir; they belong to a
  friend of mine.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t ask who they belong to, sir,&quot; said the dean
  indignantly; &quot;I ask, sir, how came they in your rooms?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I believe, sir, my friend (he was in my rooms yesterday)
  left them there. Some men wear stays, sir,&quot; continued I, boldly;
  &quot;it&#39;s very much the fashion, I&#39;m told.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Eh! hum!&quot; said the dean, eyeing the brown jean
  doubtingly. &quot;I have heard of such things. Horrid puppies men are
  now. Never dreamt of such things in my younger days; but then, sir,
  <i>we</i> were not allowed to wear white trousers, and waistcoats of
  I don&#39;t know what colours; we were made to attend to the
  statutes, sir. &#39;<i>Nigri aut suspici</i>,&#39; sir, Ah! times are
  changed&#8212;times are changed, indeed! And do you mean to say, sir,
  you have a friend, a member of this university, who wears such things
  as these?&quot;</p>

  <p>I might have got clear off, if it had not been for that rascal
  Simmons. I saw him give the dean a look, and an almost imperceptible
  shake of the head.</p>

  <p>&quot;But I don&#39;t think, sir,&quot; resumed he, &quot;these
  can be a man&#39;s stays&#8212;eh, Simmons?&quot; Simmons looked
  diligently at his toes. &quot;No,&quot; said the dean, investigating
  the unhappy garment more closely&#8212;&quot;no, I fear, Simmons,
  these are female stays!&quot;</p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span>

  <p>The conscientious Simmons made no sign.</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, sir,&quot; said I, as he looked from
  Simmons to me. &quot;I don&#39;t wear stays, and I know nothing about
  them. If Simmons were to fetch a pair of Mrs Simmons&#39;s,
  sir,&quot; resumed I, &quot;you could compare them.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mrs Simmons&#39;s figure resembled a sack of flour, with a string
  round it; and, if she did wear the articles in question, they must
  have been of a pattern almost unique&#8212;made to order.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sir,&quot; said the dean, &quot;your flippancy is
  unbecoming. I shall not pursue this investigation any further; but I
  am bound to tell you, sir, this circumstance is suspicious&#8212;very
  suspicious.&quot; I could not resist a smile for the life of me.
  &quot;And doubly suspicious, sir, in your case. The eyes of the
  college are upon you, sir.&quot; He was evidently losing his temper,
  so I bowed profoundly, and he grew more irate. &quot;Ever since, sir,
  that atrocious business of the frogs, though the college authorities
  failed in discovering the guilty parties, there are some individuals,
  sir, whose conduct is watched attentively. Good-morning,
  sir.&quot;</p>

  <p>The &quot;business of the frogs,&quot; to which the dean so
  rancorously alluded, had, indeed, caused some consternation to the
  fellows of&#8212;&#8212;. There had been a marvellous story going the
  round of the papers, of a shower of the inelegant reptiles in
  question having fallen in some part of the kingdom. Old women were
  muttering prophecies, and wise men acknowledged themselves puzzled.
  The Ashmolean Society had sat in conclave upon it, and accounted so
  satisfactorily for the occurrence, that the only wonder seemed to be
  that we had not a shower of frogs, or some equally agreeable
  visitors, every rainy morning. Now, every one who has strolled round
  Christ-Church meadows on a warm evening, especially after rain, must
  have been greeted at intervals by a whole gamut of croaks; and, if he
  had the curiosity to peer into the green ditches as he passed along,
  he might catch a glimpse of the heads of the performers. Well, the
  joint reflections of myself and an ingenious friend, who were
  studying this branch of zoology while waiting for the coming up of
  the boats one night, tended to the conclusion, that a very successful
  imitation of the late &quot;Extraordinary Phenomenon&quot; might be
  got up for the edification of the scientific in our own college.
  Animals of all kinds find dealers and purchasers in Oxford. Curs of
  lowest degree have their prices. Rats, being necessary in the
  education of terriers, come rather expensive. A pole-cat&#8212;even
  with three legs only&#8212;will command a fancy price. Sparrows,
  larks, and other small birds, are retailed by the dozen on Cowley
  Marsh to gentlemen under-graduates who are aspiring to the
  pigeon-trap. But as yet there had been no demand for frogs, and there
  was quite a glut of them in the market. They were cheap accordingly;
  for a shilling a hundred we found that we might inflict the second
  plague of Egypt upon the whole university. The next evening, two
  hampers, containing, as our purveyor assured us, &quot;very prime
  &#39;uns,&quot; arrived at my rooms &quot;from Mr S&#8212;&#8212;,
  the wine merchant;&quot; and, by daylight on the following morning,
  were judiciously distributed throughout all the come-at-able premises
  within the college walls. When I awoke the next morning, I heard
  voices in earnest conversation under my window, and looked out with
  no little curiosity. The frogs had evidently produced a sensation.
  The bursar, disturbed apparently from his early breakfast, stood
  robed in an ancient dressing-gown, with the <i>Times</i> in his hand,
  on which he was balancing a frog as yellow as himself. The dean, in
  cap and surplice, on his way from chapel, was eagerly listening to
  the account which one of the scouts was giving him of the first
  discovery of the intruders.</p>

  <p>&quot;Me and my missis, sir,&quot; quoth John, &quot;was a-coming
  into college when it was hardly to say daylight, when she, as I
  reckon, sets foot upon one of &#39;em, and was like to have been
  back&#39;ards with a set of breakfast chiney as she was a-bringing in
  for one of the fresh gentlemen. She scritches out in course, and I
  looks down, and then I sees two or three a&#39; &#39;oppin about; but
  I didn&#39;t take much notice till I gets to the thoroughfare, when
  there was a whole row on &#39;em a-trying to climb up the bottom
  step; and then I calls Solomon the porter,
  and&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg
  743]</a></span></p>

  <p>Here I left my window, and, making a hasty toilet, joined a
  group of under-graduates, who were now collecting round the dean and
  bursar. I cast my eyes round the quadrangle, and was delighted with
  the success of our labours. There had been a heavy shower in the
  night, and the frogs were as lively as they could be on so ungenial a
  location as a gravelled court. In every corner was a goodly cluster,
  who were making ladders of each other&#39;s backs, as if determined
  to scale the college walls. Some, of more retiring disposition, were
  endeavouring to force themselves into crevices, and hiding their
  heads behind projections to escape the gaze of academic eyes; while a
  few active spirits seemed to be hopping a sweepstakes right for the
  common-room door. Just as I made my appearance, the principal came
  out of the door of his lodgings, with another of the fellows, having
  evidently been summoned to assist at the consultation. Good old soul!
  his study of zoology had been chiefly confined to the class edibles,
  and a shower of frogs, authenticated upon the oaths of the whole
  Convocation, would not have been half so interesting to him as an
  importation of turtle. However, to do him justice, he put on his
  spectacles, and looked as scientific as any body. After due
  examination of the specimen of the genus <i>Zana</i> which the bursar
  still held in captivity, and pronouncing an unanimous opinion, that,
  come from where he would, he was a <i>bona fide</i> frog, with
  nothing supernatural about him, the conclave proceeded round the
  quadrangle, calculating the numbers, and conjecturing the probable
  origin of these strange visitors. Equally curious, if not equally
  scientific, were the under-graduates who followed them; for, having
  strictly kept our own secret, my friend and myself were the only
  parties who could solve the mystery; and though many suspected that
  the frogs were unwilling emigrants, none knew to whom they were
  indebted for their introduction to college. The collected wisdom of
  the dons soon decided that a shower of full-grown frogs was a novelty
  even in the extraordinary occurrences of newspapers; and as not even
  a single individual croaker was to be discovered outside the walls of
  &#8212;&#8212;, it became evident that the whole affair was, as the
  dean described it, &quot;another of those outrages upon academic
  discipline, which were as senseless as they were
  disgraceful.&quot;</p>

  <p>I daresay the dean&#39;s anathema was &quot;as sensible as it was
  sincere;&quot; but it did not prevent our thoroughly enjoying the
  success of the &quot;<i>outrage</i>&quot; at the time; nor does it,
  unfortunately, suffice at this present moment to check something like
  an inward chuckle, when I think of the trouble which it cost the
  various retainers of the college to clear it effectually of its
  strange visitors. Hopkins, the old butler, who was of rather an
  imaginative temperament, and had a marvellous tale to tell any one
  who would listen, of a departed bursar, who, having caught his death
  of cold by superintending the laying down of three pipes of port,
  might ever afterwards be heard, upon such interesting occasions,
  walking about the damp cellars after nightfall in pattens. Hopkins,
  the oracle of the college &quot;tap,&quot; maintained that the frogs
  were something &quot;off the common;&quot; and strengthened his
  opinion by reference to a specimen which he had selected&#8212;a
  lank, black, skinny individual, which really looked ugly enough to
  have come from any where. Scouts, wives, and children, (they always
  make a point of having large families, in order to eat up the spare
  commons,) all were busy, through that eventful day, in a novel
  occupation, and by dinnertime not a frog was to be seen; but long,
  long afterwards, on a moist evening, fugitives from the general
  prescription might be seen making their silent way across the
  quadrangle, and croakings were heard at night-time, which might (as
  Homer relates of <i>his</i> frogs) have disturbed Minerva, only that
  the goddess of wisdom, in chambers collegiate, sleeps usually pretty
  sound.</p>

  <p>The &quot;business of the stays,&quot; however, bid fair to
  supersede the business of the frogs, in the dean&#39;s record of my
  supposed crimes; and as I fully intended to clear myself, even to his
  satisfaction, of any suspicion which might attach to me from the
  possession of such questionable articles so soon as our theatre
  closed for the season, I resolved that my successful defence from
  this last imputation would be an admirable ground on which to assume
  the dignity of a martyr, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_744" id=
  "Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span> to appeal against all uncharitable
  conclusions from insufficient premises, and come out as the
  personification of injured innocence throughout my whole college
  career.</p>

  <p>When my interview with the dean was over, I ordered some luncheon
  up to Leicester&#39;s rooms, where, as I expected, I found most of my
  own &quot;set&quot; collected, in order to hear the result. A private
  conference with the official aforesaid seldom boded good to the party
  so favoured; the dean seldom made his communications so agreeable as
  he might have done. In college, as in most other societies, La
  Rochefoucauld&#39;s maxim holds good&#8212;that &quot;there is always
  something pleasant in the misfortunes of one&#39;s friends;&quot;
  and, whenever an unlucky wight did get into a row, he might pretty
  confidently reckon upon being laughed at. In fact, under-graduates
  considered themselves as engaged in a war of stratagem against an
  unholy alliance of deans, tutors, and proctors; and in every
  encounter the defeated party was looked upon as the deluded victim of
  superior ingenuity&#8212;as having been &quot;done,&quot; in short.
  So, if a lark succeeded, the authorities aforesaid were decidedly
  done, and laughed at accordingly; if it failed, why the other party
  were done, and there was still somebody to laugh at. No doubt, the
  jest was richer in the first case supposed; but, in the second, there
  was the additional gusto, so dear to human philanthropy, of having
  the victim present, and enjoying his discomfiture, which, in the case
  of the dons being the sufferers, was denied us. It may seem to argue
  something of a want of sympathy to find amusement in misfortunes
  which might any day be our own; but any one who ever witnessed the
  air of ludicrous alarm with which an under-graduate prepares to obey
  the summons, (capable of but one interpretation,)&#8212;&quot;The
  dean wishes to see you, sir, at ten o&#39;clock&quot;&#8212;which so
  often, in my time at least, was sent as a whet to some of the
  assembled guests at a breakfast party; whoever has been applied to on
  such occasions for the loan of a tolerable cap, (that of the
  delinquent having its corners in such dilapidated condition as to
  proclaim its owner a &quot;rowing man&quot; at once,) or has
  responded to the pathetic appeal&#8212;&quot;Do I look <i>very</i>
  seedy?&quot;&#8212;any one to whom such absurd recollections of early
  days occur&#8212;and if you, good reader, are a university man, as,
  being a gentleman, I am bound in charity to conclude you are, and yet
  have no such reminiscences&#8212;allow me to suggest that you must
  have been a very slow coach indeed;&#8212;any one, I say once more,
  who knows the ridiculous figure which a man cuts when &quot;hauled
  up&quot; before the college Minos, or Radamanthus, will easily
  forgive his friends for being inclined to laugh at him.</p>

  <p>However, in the present case, any anticipations of fun at my
  expense, which the party in Leicester&#39;s rooms might charitably
  entertain, were somewhat qualified by the fear, that the consequences
  of any little private difference between the dean and myself might
  affect the prosperity of our unlicensed theatre. And when they heard
  how very nearly the discovery of the stays had been fatal to our
  project, execrations against Simmons&#39;s espionage were mingled
  with admiration of my escape from so critical a position.</p>

  <p>The following is, I apprehend, an unique specimen of an Oxford
  bill&#8212;and the only one, out of a tolerably large bundle which I
  keep for the sake of the receipts attached, (a precaution by no means
  uncalled for,) which I find any amusement in referring to.</p>

  <p>(Savile, when I showed it to him, said the receipt was the only
  one of the kind he had seen in the course of a long experience.) Very
  much surprised was the old lady, of whom I made the purchase in my
  capacity of stage-manager, at so uncommon a customer in her line of
  business; and when, after enjoying her mystification for some time, I
  let her into the secret, so delighted was she at the notion, that she
  gave me sundry hints as to the management of the female toilet, and
  offered to get made up for me any dresses that might be required. So
  I introduced Leicester and his fellow-heroines to my friend Mrs
  Moore, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg
  745]</a></span>and by the joint exertions of their own tastes and her
  experience, they became possessed of some very tolerable costumes.
  There was a good deal of fun going on, I fancy, in fitting and
  measuring, in her back parlour; for there was a daughter, or a niece,
  or something of the sort, who cut out the dresses with the prettiest
  hands in the world, as Leicester declared; but I was too busy with
  carpenters, painters, and other assistants, to pay more than a flying
  visit to the ladies&#39; department.</p>

  <p>At last the rehearsal did come on. As Hastings, I had not much in
  the way of dress to alter; and, having some engagement in the early
  part of the morning, I did not arrive at the theatre until the rest
  of the characters were already dressed and ready to begin. Though I
  had been consulted upon all manner of points, from the arranging of a
  curl for Miss Neville to the colour of Diggory&#39;s stockings, and
  knew the costume of every individual as well as my own, yet so
  ludicrous was the effect of the whole when I entered the room, that I
  threw myself into the nearest chair, and laughed myself nearly into
  convulsions. The figure which first met my eyes was a little ruddy
  freshman, who had the part of the landlord, and who, in his zeal to
  do honour to our preference, had dressed the character most
  elaborately. A pillow, which he could scarcely see over, puffed out
  his red waistcoat; and his hair was cut short, and powdered with such
  good-will, that for weeks afterwards, in spite of diligent brushing,
  he looked as grey as the principal. There he stood&#8212;his legs
  clothed in grey worsted, retreating far beyond his little white
  apron, as if ashamed of their unusual appearance,</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;The mother that him
    bare,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">She had not known her
    son.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>Every one, however, had not been so classical in their costume.
  There was Sir Charles Marlow in what had been a judge&#39;s wig, and
  Mr Hardcastle in a barrister&#39;s; both sufficiently unlike
  themselves, at any rate, if not very correct copies of their
  originals. Then the women! As for Mrs Hardcastle, she was perfection.
  There never was, I believe, a better representation of the character.
  It was well dressed, and turned out a first-rate bit of
  acting&#8212;very far superior to any amateur performance I ever saw,
  and, with practice, would have equalled that of any actress on the
  stage. Her very curtsy was comedy itself. When I recovered my breath
  a little, I was able to attend to the dialogue which was going on,
  which was hardly less ridiculous than the strange disguises round me.
  &quot;Now, Miss Hardcastle,&quot; (Marlow <i>loquitur</i>,) &quot;I
  have no objection to your smoking cigars during rehearsal, of
  course&#8212;because you won&#39;t do that on Monday night, I
  suppose; but I must beg you to get out of the practice of standing or
  sitting crosslegged, because it&#39;s not lady-like, or even
  barmaid-like&#8212;and don&#39;t laugh when I make love to you; for
  if you do, I shall break down to a certainty.&quot; &quot;Thornhill,
  do you think my waist will do?&quot; said the anxious representative
  of the fair Constance. &quot;I have worn these cursed stays for an
  hour every evening for the last week, and drawn them an inch tighter
  every time; but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a very good figure after
  all&#8212;just try if they&#39;ll come any closer, will you?&quot;
  &quot;Oh! Hawthorne, I&#39;m glad you are come,&quot; said Savile,
  whom I hardly knew, in a red wig; &quot;now, isn&#39;t there to be a
  bowl of real punch in the scene at the Three Pigeons&#8212;one
  can&#39;t <i>pretend</i> to drink, you know, with any degree of
  spirit?&quot; &quot;Oh! of course,&quot; said I; &quot;that&#39;s one
  of the landlord&#39;s properties: Miller, you must provide that, you
  know&#8212;send down for some cold tankards now; they will do very
  well for rehearsal.&quot; At last we got to work, and proceeded, with
  the prompter&#39;s assistance, pretty smoothly, and mutually
  applauding each other&#39;s performance, going twice over some of the
  more difficult scenes, and cutting out a good deal of love and
  sentiment. The play was fixed for the next Monday night, playbills
  ordered to be printed, and cards of invitation issued to all the
  performers&#39; intimate friends. Every scout in the college, I
  believe, except my rascal Simmons, was in the secret, and probably
  some of the fellows had a shrewd guess at what was going on; but no
  one interfered with us. We carried on all our operations as quietly
  as possible; and the only circumstances likely to arouse suspicion in
  the minds of the authorities, was the unusual absence of all
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg
  746]</a></span> disturbances of a minor nature within the walls, in
  consequence of the one engrossing freak in which most of the more
  turbulent spirits were engaged.</p>

  <p>At length the grand night arrived. By nine o&#39;clock the theatre
  in Savile&#39;s rooms was as full as it could be crammed with any
  degree of comfort to actors and audience; and in the study and
  bedroom, which, being on opposite sides, served admirably for
  dressing-rooms behind the scenes, the usual bustle of preparation was
  going on. As is common in such cases, some essential properties had
  been forgotten until the last moment. No bonnet had been provided for
  Mrs Hardcastle to take her walks abroad in; and when the little
  hairdresser, who had been retained to give a finishing touch to some
  of the coiffeurs, returned with one belonging to his
  &quot;missis,&quot; which he had volunteered to lend, the roar of
  uncontrollable merriment which this new embellishment of our
  disguised friend called forth, made the audience clamorous for the
  rising of the curtain&#8212;thinking, very excusably, that it was
  quite unjustifiable to keep all the fun to ourselves.</p>

  <p>After some little trial of our &quot;public&#39;s&quot; patience,
  the play began in good earnest, and was most favourably received.
  Indeed, as the only price of admission exacted was a promise of civil
  behaviour, and there were two servants busily employed in handing
  about punch and &quot;bishop,&quot; it would have been rather hard if
  we did not succeed in propitiating their good-humour. With the
  exception of two gentlemen who had been dining out, and were rather
  noisy in consequence, and evinced a strong inclination occasionally
  to take a part in the dialogue, all behaved wonderfully well,
  greeting each performer, as he made his first entrance, with a due
  amount of cheering; rapturously applauding all the best scenes;
  laughing, (whether at the raciness of the acting or the grotesque
  metamorphoses of the actors, made no great difference,) and filling
  up any gap which occurred in the proceedings on the stage, in spite
  of the prompter, with vociferous encouragement to the
  &quot;sticket&quot; actor. With an audience so disposed, each
  successive scene went off better and better. One deserves to be
  particularized. It was the second in the first act of the comedy; the
  stage directions for it are as follow:&#8212;&quot;Scene&#8212;An
  ale-house room.&#8212;Several shabby fellows with punch and tobacco;
  Tony at the head of the table, &amp;c., discovered.&quot; Never
  perhaps, in any previous representation, was the <i>mise en scÃ¨ne</i>
  so perfect. It drew three rounds of applause. A very equivocal
  compliment to ourselves it may be; but such jolly-looking
  &quot;shabby fellows&quot; as sat round the table at which our Tony
  presided, were never furnished by the supernumeraries of Drury or
  Covent-garden. They were as classical, in their way, as
  Macready&#39;s Roman mob. Then there was no make-believe puffing of
  empty pipes, and fictitious drinking of small-beer for punch; every
  nose among the audience could appreciate the genuineness of both
  liquor and tobacco; and the hearty encore which the song, with its
  stentorian chorus, was honoured with, gave all the parties engaged
  time to enjoy their punch and their pipes to their satisfaction. It
  was quite a pity, as was unanimously agreed, when the entrance of
  Marlow and Hastings, as in duty bound, interrupted so jovial a
  society. But &quot;all that&#39;s bright must fade&quot;&#8212;and so
  the Three Pigeons&#39; scene, and the play, too, came to an end in
  due course. The curtain fell amidst universal applause, modified only
  by the urgent request, which, as manager, I had more than once to
  repeat, that gentlemen would be kind enough to restrain their
  feelings for fear of disturbing the dons. The house resolved itself
  into its component elements&#8212;all went their ways&#8212;the
  reading men probably to a Greek play, by way of
  afterpiece&#8212;sleepy ones to bed, and idle ones to their various
  inventions&#8212;and the actors, after the fatigues of the night, to
  a supper, which was to be the &quot;finish.&quot; It was to take
  place in one of the men&#39;s rooms which happened to be on the same
  staircase, and had been committed to the charge of certain parties,
  who understood our notions of an unexceptionable spread. And a right
  merry party we were&#8212;all sitting down in character, Mrs
  Hardcastle at the top of the table, her worthy partner at bottom,
  with the &quot;young ladies&quot; on each side. It was the best
  <i>tableau</i> of the evening; pity there was neither artist to
  sketch, nor spectators to admire it! But, like <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</a></span> many
  other merry meetings, there are faithful portraits of it&#8212;proof
  impressions&#8212;in the memories of many who were present; not yet
  obliterated, hardly even dimmed, by time; laid by, like other
  valuables, which, in the turmoil of life, we find no time to look at,
  but not thrown aside or forgotten, and brought out sometimes, in
  holidays and quiet hours, for us to look at once more, and enjoy
  their beauty, and feel, after all, how much what we have changed is
  &quot;<i>calum non animum</i>.&quot; I am now&#8212;no matter what.
  Of my companions at that well-remembered supper, one is a staid and
  orthodox divine; one a rising barrister; a third a respectable
  country gentleman, justice of the peace, &quot;and quorum;&quot; a
  fourth, they tell me, a semi Papist, but set us all down together in
  that same room, draw the champagne corks, and let some Lethe (the
  said champagne, if you please) wash out all that has passed over us
  in the last five years, and my word on it, three out of four of us
  are but boys still; and though much shaving, pearl powder, and
  carmine, might fail to make of any of the party a heroine of any more
  delicate class than Meg Merrilies, I have no doubt we could all of us
  once more smoke a pipe in character at &quot;The Three
  Pigeons.&quot;</p>

  <p>Merrily the evening passed off, and merrily the little hours came
  on, and song and laugh rather grew gayer than slackened. The strings
  of the stays had long ago been cut, and the tresses, which were in
  the way of the cigars, were thrown back in dishevelled elegance. The
  landlord found his stuffing somewhat warm, and had laid aside half
  his fleshy incumbrance. Every one was at his ease, and a most
  uproarious chorus had just been sung by the whole strength of the
  company, when we heard the ominous sound of a quiet double rap at the
  outer door.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; said one of the most self-possessed
  of the company.</p>

  <p>&quot;I wish to speak to Mr Challoner,&quot; was the quiet
  reply.</p>

  <p>The owner of the rooms was luckily in no more <i>outrÃ©</i> costume
  than that of Sir Charles Marlow; and having thrown off his wig, and
  buttoned his coat over a deep-flapped waistcoat, looked tolerably
  like himself as he proceeded to answer the summons. I confess I
  rather hoped than otherwise, that the gentleman, whoever he was,
  would walk in, when, if he intended to astonish us, he was very
  likely to find the tables turned. However, even college dons
  recognize the principle, that every man&#39;s house is his castle,
  and never violate the sanctity of even an under-graduate&#39;s rooms.
  The object of this present visit, however, was rather friendly than
  otherwise; one of the fellows, deservedly popular, had been with the
  dean, and had left him in a state of some excitement from the
  increasing merriment which came somewhat too audibly across the
  quadrangle from our party. He had called, therefore, to advise
  Challoner, either to keep his friends quiet, or to get rid of them,
  if he wished to keep out of the dean&#39;s jurisdiction. As it was
  towards three in the morning, we thought it prudent to take this
  advice as it was meant, and in a few minutes began to wend our
  respective ways homewards. Leicester and myself, whose rooms lay in
  the same direction, were steering along, very soberly, under a bright
  moonlight, when something put it into the heads of some other
  stragglers of the party to break out, at the top of their voices,
  into a stanza of that immortal ditty&#8212;&quot;We won&#39;t go home
  till morning.&quot; Instantly we could hear a window, which we well
  knew to be the dean&#39;s, open above us, and as the unmelodious
  chorus went on, his wrath found vent in the usual
  strain&#8212;&quot;Who is making that disturbance?&quot;</p>

  <p>No one volunteering an explanation, he went on.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who are those in the quadrangle?&quot; Leicester and I
  walked somewhat faster. I am not sure that our dignity did not
  condescend to run, as we heard steps coming down from No. 5, at a
  pace that evidently portended a chase, and remembered for the first
  time the remarkable costume, which, to common observers, would
  indicate that there was a visitor of an unusual character enjoying
  the moonlight in the quadrangle. When we reached the
  &quot;thoroughfare,&quot; the passage from the inner to the outer
  quadrangle, we fairly bolted; and as the steps came pretty fast after
  us, and Leicester&#39;s rooms were the nearest, we both made good our
  retreat thither, and sported oak.</p>

  <p>The porter&#39;s lodge was in the next number; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span> and
  hearing a knocking in that quarter, Leicester gently opened the
  window, and we could catch the following dialogue:&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Solomon! open this door directly&#8212;it is I&#8212;the
  dean.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Good, dear sir!&quot; said Solomon, apparently asleep, and
  fumbling for the keys of the college gates&#8212;&quot;let you out?
  Oh yes! sir, directly.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Listen to me, Solomon: I am not going out. Did you let any
  one out just now&#8212;just before I called you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, sir, nobody whatsomdever.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Solomon! I ask you, did you not, just now, let a
  <i>woman</i> out?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Lawk! no, sir, Lord forbid!&quot; said Solomon, now
  thoroughly wakened.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now, Solomon, bring your light, and come with me, this must
  be enquired into. I saw a woman run this way, and, if she is not gone
  through the gate, she is gone into this next number. Whose rooms are
  in No. 13?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There&#39;s Mr Dyson&#39;s, sir, on the ground
  floor.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Dyson was the very fellow who had called at Challoner&#39;s
  rooms.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hah! well, I&#39;ll call Mr Dyson up. Whose
  besides?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There&#39;s Mr Leicester, sir, above his&#39;n.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well, Solomon; call up Mr Dyson, and say I wish to
  speak with him particularly.&quot;</p>

  <p>And so saying, the dean proceeded up stairs.</p>

  <p>The moment Leicester heard his name mentioned, he began to
  anticipate a domiciliary visit. The thing was so ridiculous that we
  hardly knew what to do.</p>

  <p>&quot;Shall I get into bed, Hawthorne? I don&#39;t want to be
  caught in this figure?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, I don&#39;t know that you will be safe there, in the
  present state of the dean&#39;s suspicions. No; tuck up those
  confounded petticoats, clap on your pea-jacket, twist those
  love-locks up under your cap, light this cigar, and sit in your
  easy-chair. The dean must be &#39;cuter than usual, if he finds you
  out as the lady he is in search of.&quot;</p>

  <p>Leicester had hardly time to take this advice, the best I could
  hit upon at the moment, when the dean knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who are you? Come in,&quot; said we both in a breath.</p>

  <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Mr Leicester,&quot; said the dean in his
  most official tone; &quot;nothing but actually imperative duty
  occasions my intrusion at this unseasonable hour, but a most
  extraordinary circumstance must be my excuse. I say,
  gentlemen&#8212;I saw with my own eyes,&quot; he continued, looking
  blacker as he caught sight of me, and remembering, no doubt, the
  little episode of the stays&#8212;&quot;I saw a female figure pass in
  this direction but a few minutes ago. No such person has passed the
  gate, for I have made enquiry; certainly I have no reason to suppose
  any such person is concealed here, but I am bound to ask you, sir, on
  your honour as a gentleman&#8212;for I have no wish to make a
  search&#8212;is there any such person concealed in your
  apartments?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;On my honour, sir, no one is, or has been lately here, but
  myself and Mr Hawthorne.&quot;</p>

  <p>Here Dyson came into the room, looking considerably mystified.</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Mr Dean?&quot; said he, nodding
  good-humouredly to us.</p>

  <p>&quot;A most unpleasant occurrence, my dear sir; I have seen a
  woman in this direction not five minutes back. Unfortunately, I
  cannot be mistaken. She either passed into the porter&#39;s lodge or
  into this staircase.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She is not in my rooms, I assure you,&quot; said he,
  laughing; &quot;I should think you made a mistake: it must have been
  some man in a white mackintosh.&quot;</p>

  <p>I smiled, and Leicester laughed outright.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am not mistaken, sir,&quot; said the dean warmly. &quot;I
  shall take your word, Mr Leicester; but allow me to tell you, that
  your conduct in lolling in that chair as if in perfect contempt, and
  neither rising, nor removing your cap, when Mr Dyson and myself are
  in your rooms, is neither consistent with the respect due from an
  under-graduate, or the behaviour I should expect from a
  gentleman.&quot;</p>

  <p>Poor Leicester coloured, and unwittingly removed his cap. The
  chestnut curls, some natural and some artificial, which had been so
  studiously arranged for Miss Hardcastle&#39;s head-dress, fell in
  dishevelled luxuriance round his face, and as he half <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span> rose
  from his previous position in the chair, a pink silk dress began to
  descend from under the pea-jacket. Concealment was at an end; the
  dean looked bewildered at first, and then savage; but a hearty laugh
  from Dyson settled the business.</p>

  <p>&quot;What, Leicester! you&#39;re the lady the dean has been
  hunting about college! Upon my word, this is the most absurd piece of
  masquerading!&#8212;what on earth is it all about?&quot;</p>

  <p>I pitied Leicester, he looked such an extraordinary figure in his
  ambiguous dress, and seemed so thoroughly ashamed of himself; so
  displaying the tops and cords in which I had enacted Hastings, I
  acknowledged my share in the business, and gave a brief history of
  the drama during my management. The dean endeavoured to look grave:
  Dyson gave way to undisguised amusement, and repeatedly exclaimed,
  &quot;Oh! why did you not send me a ticket? When do you perform
  again?&quot;</p>

  <p>Alas! never. Brief, as bright, was our theatrical career. But the
  memory of it lives in the college still: of the comedy, and the
  supper, and the curious mistake which followed it: and the dean has
  not to this hour lost the credit which he then gained, of having a
  remarkably keen eye for a petticoat.</p>

      Castle is first mentioned in history in connexion with its siege
      by Husbac the Norwegian, and Olave king of Man, in 1228. Among

      boiling pitch and lead on the heads of their enemies; but it was,
      however, at length taken, after the Norwegians had lost three

      apparently of the kind in use about the time of Robert the Second
      or Third. His feet are upon a lion couchant, and his head upon a
      faithful watch-dog, with a collar, in beautiful preservation,
      encircling its neck. The coat-of-arms denotes the person
      represented to have been of royal lineage. Popular tradition
      individualizes him as the &quot;Stout Stewart of Bonkill&quot; of

  <h2><a name="TRAVELS_OF_KERIM_KHAN" id=
  "TRAVELS_OF_KERIM_KHAN"></a>TRAVELS OF KERIM KHAN.</h2>

  <h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

  <p>While tracing the progress of our friend the Khan through the
  various scenes of amusement and festivity at which he assisted rather
  as a spectator than an actor, we had omitted to notice in its proper
  place an incident of some interest&#8212;his presence at the opening
  of the Parliamentary session of 1841, on the 26th of January, by the
  Queen in person. By the kindness of one of his friends, who was a
  member of the royal household, he had succeeded in obtaining a ticket
  of admission to the House of Lords, and was placed in a position
  which afforded him an excellent view of the brilliant multitude
  assembled to receive their sovereign. &quot;When I had sufficiently
  recovered from the first impression of all the magnificence around
  me, I could compare it only to the Garden of Trem<a name=
  "FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
  class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&#8212;nay, it appeared even more wonderful
  than that marvellous place. At twelve o&#39;clock, twenty-one peals
  of artillery announced the approach of the Queen, who shortly after
  entered with Prince Albert, followed by her train-bearers, &amp;c.
  All rose as she advanced; and when the Lords were again seated, the
  <i>cadhi-ab-codhat</i> (Lord Chancellor) put a piece of paper in her
  hands, and placed himself on the right of the throne, while the
  grand-vizir stood on the left. Shortly after, the gentlemen of the
  House of Commons entered, when the Queen read with a loud voice from
  the paper to the following effect.&quot; We need not, however, follow
  the Khan through the details of the royal speech, or the debate on
  the address which succeeded, though, in the latter, he appears to
  have been thunderstruck by the freedom of language indulged in by a
  certain eccentric ex-chancellor, remarking, &quot;that under the
  emperors of Delhi such latitude of speech, in reference to the
  sovereign, would inevitably have cost the offender his head, or at
  least have ensured his spending the remainder of his life in disgrace
  and exile at Mekka.&quot; On the dignified bearing and
  self-possession of our youthful sovereign, the Khan enlarges in the
  strain of eulogy which might be expected from one to whom the sight
  of the ensigns of sovereignty borne by a female hand was in itself an
  almost inconceivable novelty, declaring, that &quot;the justice and
  virtues of her Majesty have obliterated the name of Nushirvan from
  the face of the earth!&quot; But the remarks of the simple-minded
  Parsees on the same subject will be found, from their honest
  sincerity, we suspect, more germane to the matter&#8212;&quot;We saw
  in an instant that she was fitted by nature for, and intended to be,
  a queen; we saw a native nobility about her, which induced us to
  believe that she could, though meek and amiable, be firm and
  decisive; ... that no man or set of men would be permitted by her to
  dictate a line of conduct; and that, knowing and feeling that she
  lived in the hearts and affections of her people, she would endeavour
  to temper justice with mercy; and we thought that if no unforeseen
  event (which God forbid) arose to dim the lustre of her reign, that
  the period of her sway in Britain would be quoted as the golden
  age.&quot;</p>

  <p>After this introduction, the Khan appears to have become an
  occasional attendant in the gallery of the House of Commons, and was
  present at a debate on the admission of foreign corn, in which Lord
  Stanley, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord John Russell took
  part&#8212;&quot;These three being the most eloquent of the speakers,
  and the chiefs of their respective parties, though several other
  members spoke at great length either for or against the motion,
  according as each was attached to one or other of the great factions
  which divide the House of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_754"
  id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span> Commons, and hold the destinies of
  the people in their hands.&quot; Of the speeches of these three
  leaders, and the arguments adduced by them, he accordingly attempts
  to give an abstract; though as his information must have been
  derived, we imagine, principally through the medium of an
  interpreter, this first essay at Parliamentary reporting is not
  particularly successful; and if we are to conclude, from his constant
  use of the phrase <i>zemindars</i> to denote the landed interest,
  that he considered the estates of the English proprietors to be held
  by <i>zemindarry</i> tenures similar to those in Bengal, his notions
  on the subject of the debate must have been considerably perplexed.
  &quot;At length, however, as the debate had already been protracted
  to a late hour, and there was no probability of a speedy termination
  to this war of words, I left the House with no unfavourable
  impression of what I had heard. This eternal wrangling between the
  two factions is inherent, it appears, in the nature of the
  constitution. With us, two wise men never dispute; yet every
  individual member of the legislature is supposed to possess a certain
  share of wisdom&#8212;so that here are a thousand wise men constantly
  disputing. One would think no good could result from such endless
  differences of opinion; but the fact is the reverse&#8212;for from
  these debates result those measures which mark the character of the
  English for energy and love of liberty.&quot;</p>

  <p>But though thus constantly alluding to the two great political
  parties which divide the state, the Khan nowhere attempts to give his
  readers a definition of the essential differences which separate
  them; and, for a statement of the respective tenets of Whigs and
  Tories, as represented to an oriental, we must once more have
  recourse to the journal of Najaf Kooli, who has apparently taken
  great pains to make himself acquainted with this abstruse subject.
  &quot;The Tories,&quot; says the Persian prince, &quot;argue as
  follows:&#8212;&#39;Three hundred years ago we were wild people, and
  our kingdom ranked lower than any other. But, through our wisdom and
  learning, we have brought it to its present height of honour, and, as
  the empire was enlarged under our management, why should we now
  <i>reform</i> and give up our policy which has done all this
  good?&#39; To which the Whigs reply&#8212;&#39;It is more prudent to
  go according to the changes of time and circumstances. Moreover, by
  the old policy, only a few were benefited; and, as government is for
  the general good, we must observe that which is best for the whole
  nation, so that all should be profited.&#39;&quot; The
  Shahzadeh&#39;s description of the ceremony of opening Parliament,
  and his summary of the usual topics touched upon in the royal speech,
  are marked by the same amusing <i>naÃ¯vetÃ©</i>&#8212;&quot;When all
  are met, the king, arrayed in all his majestic splendour and state,
  with the crown on his head, stands up with his face to the assembly,
  and makes a speech with perfect eloquence as
  follows:&#8212;&#39;Thank God that my kingdom is in perfect
  happiness, and all the affairs, both at home and abroad, are in good
  order. All the foreign badishahs (kings and emperors) have sent to me
  ambassadors, assuring me of their friendship. The commerce of this
  empire is enjoying the highest prosperity; and all these benefits are
  through your wise ordination of affairs last session. This year also
  I have to request you again to meet in your houses, and to take all
  affairs into the consideration of your high skill and learning, and
  settle them as you find best. Should there be any misunderstanding in
  any part which may require either war or peace to be declared, you
  will thereupon also take the proper measures for settling it
  according to the welfare and interests of the kingdom.&#39; Then they
  receive their instructions, the king leaves them, and they meet every
  day, Sunday excepted, from one o&#39;clock in the afternoon till four
  hours after sunset. They take all things into consideration, and
  decide all questions; and when there is a difference of opinion there
  will arise loud voices and vehement disputes.&quot;</p>

  <p>But we must now return to the movements of the Khan, after the
  Lord Mayor&#39;s dinner, described in our last Number, in the world
  of amusement which surrounded him in London. His next visit, when he
  recovered from the fit of meditation into which he was thrown by the
  sight of the marvellous banquet aforesaid, was to the Colosseum; but
  his account of the wonders of this celebrated place of <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</a></span>
  resort, perhaps from his faculties still being in some measure
  abstracted, is less full than might have been expected. The
  ascending-room (which the Persian prince describes as &quot;rising
  like an eagle with large wings into the atmosphere, till, after an
  hour&#39;s time, it stopped in the sky, and opened its beak, so that
  we came out&quot;) he merely alludes to as &quot;the talismanic
  process by which I was carried to the upper regions;&quot; and though
  the panoramic view of London is pronounced to be, &quot;of all the
  wonders of the metropolis the most wonderful,&quot; it is dismissed
  with the remark that &quot;it is useless to attempt to describe it in
  detail. After this,&quot; continues the Khan, &quot;I passed under
  ground among some artificial caves, which I at first took for the
  dens of wild beasts; and that people should pay for seeing such
  places as these, does seem a strange taste. By going a short distance
  out of Delhi, a man may enter as many such places as he pleases,
  bearing in mind, at the same time, that he runs the greatest chance
  in the world of encountering a grinning hyÃ¦na, or some such beast;
  and it was with some such feeling that I entered these grottoes, not
  being exactly acquainted with their nature.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Khan had now nearly exhausted the circle of places of public
  entertainment; but one yet remained to be visited, and that, perhaps,
  the most congenial of all to oriental tastes in the style of its
  decorations, brilliant lights, and multifarious
  displays&#8212;Vauxhall. &quot;A large garden! a
  paradise!&quot;&#8212;such is the rapturous description of the
  Persian princes&#8212;&quot;filled with roses of various hues, with
  cool waters running in every direction on the beautiful green, and
  pictures painted on every wall. There were burning about two millions
  of lamps, each of a different colour; and we saw here such
  fire-works, as made us forget all others we had already seen. Here
  and there were young moon-faces selling refreshments; and in every
  walk there were thousands of Frank <i>moons</i> (ladies) led by the
  hand, while the roses grew pale with admiring their beautiful
  cheeks.&quot; The Khan, though less ardent and enthusiastic than the
  grandsons of Futteh Ali Shah, does ample justice to the splendour of
  the illumination; &quot;thousands of lights distributed over the
  gardens, suspended on the trees, and arranged in numberless fanciful
  devices, so as to form flowers, names, &amp;c.; and when it became
  dark, one blaze of bright light was presented, extending over a vast
  space.&quot; He was fortunate, moreover, in making his visit to the
  gardens on the evening of a balloon ascent, &quot;and thus I
  witnessed the most wonderful sight I ever saw&#8212;a sight which a
  hundred millions of people in India consider to be a <i>Feringhi</i>
  fiction, an incredible fable; for though a Frenchman made an ascent
  at Lucknow some years ago, nobody believes it who did not see it, and
  many even who were present, believed that their senses had been
  beguiled by magic.... A car in the shape of a <i>howdah</i> was swung
  by ropes beneath the balloon, in which six individuals seated
  themselves, besides the Ã¦ronaut; and when it was filled with the gas
  and ready to start, the latter tried to prevail on me to take a seat,
  telling me he had performed nearly three hundred Ã¦rial voyages, and
  that, if any accident should happen, he himself would be the first to
  suffer. I certainly had a wish to satisfy my curiosity, by ascending
  to the skies, but was dissuaded by the friends who accompanied me,
  who said it was safer to remain on <i>terra firma</i>, and look on at
  the voyagers; and accordingly I did so.&quot;</p>

  <p>Though it would appear that the Khan had already paid more than
  one visit to the treasures of art and nature collected within the
  walls of the British Museum, his description of that institution,
  &quot;one like which I had never before heard of,&quot; is reserved
  almost to the last in the catalogue of the wonders of London; and his
  remarks on the numberless novel objects which presented themselves at
  every turn to his gaze, form one of the most curious and interesting
  passages in his journal. The brilliant plumage of the birds in the
  gallery of natural history, and particularly of the humming birds
  &quot;from the far isles of the Western Sea,&quot; the splendour of
  which outshone even the gorgeous feathered tribes of his native East,
  excited his admiration to the highest degree&#8212;&quot;animals
  likewise from every country of the earth were placed around, and
  might have been mistaken for living beings, from the gloss of their
  skins <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[Pg
  756]</a></span> and the brightness of their eyes.&quot; The library,
  &quot;containing, as I was told, 300,000 volumes, among which were
  20,000 Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts,&quot; is briefly
  noticed; and the sight of the mummies in the Egyptian collection sets
  the Khan moralizing, not in the most novel strain, on these relics of
  bygone mortality. The sculptures were less to his taste&#8212;the
  Egyptian colossi are alluded to as &quot;the work in former days, I
  suppose, of some of the mummies up stairs;&quot; and the Grecian
  statues &quot;would appear, to an unbiassed stranger, a quantity of
  useless, mutilated <i>idols</i>, representing both men and monsters;
  but in the eyes of the English, it is a most valuable collection,
  said to have cost seven <i>lakhs</i> of rupees, (Â£70,000,) and
  venerated as containing some of the finest sculptures in the world. I
  cannot understand how such importance can be attached in Europe to
  this art, since the use of all images is as distinctly forbidden by
  the <i>Tevr&#257;t</i>, (Bible,) as it is by our own law ... But the
  strangest sight was in one of the upper rooms, which contains
  specimens of extinct monsters, recently discovered in the bowels of
  the earth in a fossil state, and supposed to be thousands of years
  old. Many men of science pass their whole lives in inventing names
  for these creatures, and studying the shape of a broken tooth
  supposed to have belonged to them; the science to which this
  appertains, being a branch of that relating to minerals, of which
  there is in the next room a vast collection ranged in well-polished
  cases, with the names written on them.... Among these, the most
  extraordinary were some stones said to have fallen from the sky, one
  of which was near 300 lbs. in weight, and with regard to the origin
  of which their philosophers differ. The most generally received
  opinion is, that they were thrown from volcanoes in the moon, thus
  assuming, first, the existence of volcanoes there; secondly, their
  possessing sufficient force to throw such masses to a distance,
  according to their own theory, of between 200,000 and 300,000 miles;
  and this through regions, the nature of which is wholly unknown. This
  hypothesis cannot be maintained according to the Ptolemaic system;
  indeed, it is in direct contravention to it.&quot;</p>

  <p>The perverse abandonment by the Feringhis of the time-honoured
  system of Ptolemy, in favour of the new-fangled theories of
  Copernicus, by which the earth is degraded from its recognised and
  respectable station in the centre of the universe, to a subordinate
  grade in the solar system, seems to have been a source of great
  scandal and perplexity to the Khan; &quot;since,&quot; as he remarks,
  &quot;the former doctrine is supported by their own Bible, not less
  than by our Koran.&quot; These sentiments are repeated whenever the
  subject is referred to; and particularly on the occasion of a visit
  to the Observatory at Greenwich, where he was shown all the
  telescopes and astronomical apparatus, &quot;though, owing to the
  state of the weather, I had not the opportunity of viewing the
  heavens to satisfy myself of the correctness of the statements made
  to me. I was told, however, that on looking through these instruments
  at the moon, mountains, seas, and other signs of a world, are
  distinctly visible.&quot; After satisfying his curiosity on these
  points, the Khan proceeded to inspect the hospital, where he saw the
  pensioners at dinner in the great hall; &quot;most of these had lost
  their limbs, and those who were not maimed were very old, and nearly
  all of them had been severely wounded; indeed, it was a very
  interesting spectacle, and reflected great credit on the English
  nation, which thus provides for the old age of those who have shed
  their blood in her defence.&quot; To the charitable institutions of
  the country, indeed, we find the Khan at all times fully disposed to
  do justice; &quot;there is no better feature than this in the
  national character, for there is scarcely a disease or deformity in
  nature for which there is not some edifice, in which the afflicted
  are lodged, fed, and kindly treated. Would that we had such
  institutions in Hindustan!&quot; In pursuance of this feeling, we now
  find him visiting the Blind Asylum and the Deaf and Dumb School; and
  the circumstantial details into which he enters of the comforts
  provided for the inmates of these establishments, and the proficiency
  which many of them had attained in trades and accomplishments
  apparently inconsistent with their privations, sufficiently evidences
  the interest with which he regarded these <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[Pg 757]</a></span>
  benevolent institutions. Another spectacle of the same character,
  which he had an opportunity of witnessing about this period, was the
  annual procession of the charity children to St
  Paul&#39;s:&#8212;&quot;I obtained a seat near the officiating
  <i>imam</i> or high priest, and saw near ten thousand children of
  both sexes, belonging to the different eleemosynary establishments,
  which are deservedly the pride of this country, all clothed in an
  uniform dress, while every corner was filled with spectators. After
  the <i>khotbah</i> (prayer) was read, they began to sing, not in the
  ordinary manner, but, as I was given to understand, so as to involve
  a form of prayer and thanksgiving. I was told that they belonged to
  many schools,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
  "FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
  "fnanchor">[12]</a> and are brought here once a year, that those who
  contribute to their support may witness the progress they have made,
  as well as their health and appearance.&quot;</p>

  <p>The military college at Addiscombe, for the education of the
  cadets of the East India Company&#39;s army, would naturally be to
  the Khan an object of peculiar interest; and thither he accordingly
  repaired, in company with several of his friends, apparently members
  of the Indian direction, on the occasion of the examination of the
  students by Colonel Pasley.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
  "FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
  "fnanchor">[13]</a> &quot;After partaking of a sumptuous luncheon, we
  went to the students&#39; room, where they were examined in various
  branches of the military science, as mathematics, fortification,
  drawing, &amp;c., besides various languages, one of which was the
  Oordoo.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
  "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
  "fnanchor">[14]</a> After the close of the examination, and the
  distribution of prizes to the successful candidates,<a name=
  "FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
  class="fnanchor">[15]</a>the company repaired to the grounds, where
  the Khan was astonished by the quickness and precision with which the
  cadets took to pieces and reconstructed the pontoons, and went
  through other operations of military engineering; and still more by a
  subaqueous explosion of powder by the means of the voltaic
  battery&#8212;&quot;a method by which Colonel Pasley was engaged near
  Portsmouth in raising a vessel which had sunk there.&quot; It would
  be hardly fair to surmise the probable tendency of the Khan&#39;s
  secret thoughts on thus witnessing the care bestowed on the training
  of those destined hereafter to maintain the Feringhi yoke on his
  native country; but he expressed himself highly gratified by all that
  he saw; and we find him, shortly after, in attendance at a spectacle
  more calculated than any thing he had yet witnessed, to impress him
  with an adequate idea of British power&#8212;the launch of a
  first-rate man-of-war at Woolwich.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
  "FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
  "fnanchor">[16]</a> &quot;The sight was extremely exhilarating, from
  the fineness of the day, and the immense crowds of people, of all
  ages and both sexes, generally well dressed, who were congregated on
  the land and the water, expecting the arrival of the Queen. Her
  majesty appeared at one o&#39;clock, and proceeded to the front of
  the great ship, where a place, covered with red cloth, was prepared
  for her; I had a seat quite close, and saw it all very well.... The
  ceremony of <i>christening</i> a ship is taken from that of
  christening a child, which, as practised in the Nazarene churches,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg
  758]</a></span> consists in throwing water in its face, and saying a
  prayer; but here a bottle of wine hung before her majesty, and
  opposite to it a piece of iron, against which she pushed the bottle
  and broke it, and the wine was sprinkled over the ship, which then
  received its name.... In a short time the slips were drawn, and she
  glided nobly into the stream of the Thames amidst the shouts of the
  spectators, and anchored at a short distance. I went on board this
  immense floating castle, but observed that she was not ready for sea,
  and I was told that she would require some time to be rigged,
  provisioned, &amp;c. Our party then returned to Greenwich; and after
  my friends had dined, with whom I partook of a delicate little fish
  now in season, (whitebait,) drove back to town.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Khan had no leisure, on this occasion, to inspect the wonders
  of the <i>top-khana</i>, or arsenal; but he paid a second visit for
  the purpose a few days later, duly armed with an order from the
  Master-General of the Ordnance, which is indispensable for the
  admission of a foreigner. His sensations, on entering this vast
  repository of arms, were not unlike those attributed to a personage
  whose fictitious adventures, though the production of a
  <i>Feringhi</i> pen, present one of the most faithful pictures extant
  of the genuine feelings of an oriental on Frank
  matters:&#8212;&quot;When we came to the guns,&quot; says the
  eximious Hajji Baba, &quot;by my beard, existence fled from our
  heads! We saw cannons of all sizes and denominations, enough to have
  paved the way, if placed side by side, from Tehran to Tabriz&#8212;if
  placed lengthways, Allah only knows where they would have
  reached&#8212;into the very grave of the father of all the Russians,
  perhaps!&quot; &quot;The cannon distributed over the whole
  place,&quot; says the graver narrative of the Khan, &quot;are said to
  amount to 40,000! all ready for use in the army, navy, or fortresses;
  and, as if these were not sufficient for the destruction of the human
  race, other pieces are constantly casting by a process the reverse of
  that in India, where the guns are cast in moulds&#8212;whereas here a
  solid cylinder is cast, and afterwards bored, shaped, and finished by
  steam power.... There are, moreover, a considerable number taken from
  enemies in battle, two of which, taken from Tippoo Sultan at
  Seringapatam, have their muzzles in the form of a lion&#39;s mouth,
  and are very well cast and elaborately ornamented; having their date,
  with the weight of powder and ball they carry, expressed in Persian
  characters about the mouth. There are also three from Bhurtpore, and
  three others from Aden, the inscriptions on which denote that they
  were cast by order of the Turkish emperor, <i>Mahmood</i><a name=
  "FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"
  class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Ibn Soliman.&quot; After leaving the
  arsenal, the Khan proceeded to the dockyard, of which he merely
  enumerates the various departments; but the proving of the anchors
  and chain-cables by means of the hydraulic press, impressed him, as
  it must do every one who has witnessed that astonishing process, with
  the idea of almost illimitable power. &quot;On the ground lay a huge
  anchor which had been broken a few days before in the presence of
  Prince Albert, and when I was there four men were trying the strength
  of a chain by turning a wheel, the force produced by which was more
  than sufficient to break it; for just as I arrived it began to give
  way, when they desisted. The force here produced by means of this
  single wheel must have been equal to that of some 200,000 elephants,
  which might perhaps have pulled till doomsday without effecting it.
  Such is the wonderful effect of this agent (steam,) the results of
  which I meet with in so many different places, and under so many
  different circumstances!&quot; After visiting the convict-hulk, and
  seeing the anchor-founderies in operation, the Khan crossed to
  Blackwall, and returned to town by the railway, his first conveyance
  when he landed in England. His increased experience in
  steam-travelling had now, however, enabled him to detect the
  difference between the mode of propulsion by engines on the other
  railroads, and the &quot;immense cables made of iron wires&quot; by
  which the vehicles are drawn on this line; the construction of which,
  as well as the electro-telegraph, (&quot;a process for which we have
  no phrase in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_759" id=
  "Page_759">[Pg 759]</a></span> Oordoo,&quot;) by which communication is
  effected between the two ends of the line, he soon after paid another
  visit to inspect. &quot;This railway is carried partly over houses
  and partly under ground; and as the price of the ground was unusually
  high, I was told that it cost, though only three miles and a half in
  length, the enormous sum of a crore of rupees,
  (Â£1,000,000!&quot;)</p>

  <p>With this notice of the Blackwall railway, the personal narrative
  of the Khan&#39;s residence in England is brought to an abrupt
  conclusion; leaving us in the dark as to the time and circumstances
  of his return to his native land, which we believe took place soon
  after this period. The remainder of his work is in the nature of an
  appendix, consisting chiefly of dissertations on the manners,
  institutions, &amp;c., of Great Britain, as compared with those of
  Hindustan. He likewise gives an elaborate retrospect of English
  history, from the Britons downwards; excepting, however, the four
  centuries from the death of William the Conqueror to the accession of
  Henry VIII.&#8212;an interval which he perhaps considers to have been
  sufficiently filled up by his disquisitions on the struggles for
  power between the crown and the barons, and the consequent origin and
  final constitution of parliament, related in a previous part of his
  work. His object in undertaking this compilation was, as he informs
  us, &quot;for the benefit of those in Hindustan, who are to this day
  entirely ignorant of English history, and indifferent as to acquiring
  any knowledge whatever of a people whose sway has been extended over
  so many millions of human beings, and whose influence is felt in the
  remotest corners of the globe.&quot; The manner in which the Khan has
  performed his self-imposed task, is highly creditable to his industry
  and discrimination, and strongly contrasts, in the accuracy of the
  facts and plain sense of the narration, with the wild extravagances
  in which Asiatic historiographers are apt to indulge; the Anglo-Saxon
  part of the history, on which especial pains appears to have been
  bestowed, is particularly complete and well written&#8212;unless (as,
  indeed, we are almost inclined to suspect) it be a translation <i>in
  toto</i> from some popular historical treatise. The Khan&#39;s
  acquired knowledge of English history, indeed, is sometimes more
  accurate than his acquaintance with the annals of his own country; as
  when, in comparing Queen Elizabeth with the famous Queen of Delhi,
  Raziah Begum, he speaks of the latter princess as &quot;daughter of
  Behlol Khan, the Pathan Emperor of Delhi;&quot; whereas a reference
  to Ferishta, or any other native historian, will inform us that
  Raziah died <span class='smcap'>a.d</span>. 1239, more than 200 years
  before the accession of Behlol Lodi. No such errors as this, either
  in fact or chronology, disfigure the Khan&#39;s sketch of English
  history; but as it would scarcely present so much novelty to English
  readers as it may possibly do to the Hindustani friends of the author
  for whom it is intended, we shall give but a few brief notices of it.
  His favourite hero, in the account of the Saxon period, is of course
  Alfred, and he devotes to the events of his reign more than half the
  space occupied by the history of the dynasty;<a name="FNanchor_18_18"
  id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class=
  "fnanchor">[18]</a> thus summing up his character:&#8212;&quot;To
  describe all the excellent qualities, intellectual and moral,
  attributed to this prince by English historians, would be to condense
  in a single individual the highest perfections of which the human
  species is capable. Qualities contradictory in their natures, and
  which are possessed only by men of different characters, and scarcely
  ever by one man, seem to have been united in this monarch; he was
  humane, prudent, and peaceful, yet brave, just, and impartial;
  affable, and capable of giving and receiving counsel. In short, he
  was a man especially endowed by the Deity with virtue and
  intelligence to benefit the human race!&quot;</p>

  <p>The story of Edwy and Elgiva, and the barbarities which the
  beautiful queen suffered at the hands of Dunstan, are related with
  fitting abhorrence by the Khan, who seems to entertain, on all
  occasions, a special aversion to the ascendancy of the Romish
  priesthood. The loves of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_760" id=
  "Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span> Edgar and Elfrida, and the punishment
  of the faithless courtier who deceived his sovereign by a false
  report of the attractions of the lady, are also duly commemorated; as
  well as the fall of the Saxon kingdom before the conquering swords of
  the Danes, during the reign of Ethelred the Unready, the son of the
  false and cruel Elfrida. But the intrusive monarch Canute &quot;was
  looked upon, in those times of ignorance, as a very extraordinary
  man, and supposed to be the greatest king of the world, the sovereign
  of the seas and the land.&quot; The well-known story of his
  pretending to command the waves, as related by the Khan, differs
  considerably from the usually received version, and perhaps may be
  better adapted to the notions prevalent in the East, where success by
  stratagem is always considered preferable to a manly avowal of
  incompetency. &quot;One day he was seated on the sea-shore, when the
  waves reached his chair. Canute commanded them to retire; and as the
  tide happened to be actually ebbing at the time, the waters retreated
  to the ocean. Then turning to his courtiers, he exclaimed, that the
  king whose mandates were obeyed by the billows of the sea, as well as
  by the children of men, was truly the monarch of the earth. Ever
  after this he was regarded by the ignorant multitude with a sort of
  religious awe, and was called Canute <i>the Great</i>, as we should
  say <i>Sahib-i-kir&#257;n</i>,&quot; (the Lord of the Conjunction,
  implying a man born under a peculiar conjunction of planetary
  influences which predestines him to distinguished fortunes.)</p>

  <p>But of all the English monarchs whose reigns are noticed by the
  Khan, the one who appears to stand highest, as a pious and patriotic
  king, in his estimation&#8212;a distinction which he not improbably
  owes to his zeal as an iconoclast, the use of images in worship being
  abhorred by the Moslems&#8212;is no other than Henry VIII. No hint of
  the &quot;gospel light that beamed from Boleyn&#39;s eyes,&quot; or
  of the doom which overtook more than one of his consorts, is allowed
  to interfere with the lustre of his achievements; such allusions,
  indeed, would probably be regarded by the Khan as unwarrantable
  violations of the privacy of the zenana. But in order to set in a
  stronger light the difficulties which he had to encounter, we have a
  circumstantial account of the rise of the Papal power, and the
  exorbitant prerogatives assumed for some centuries previously, by the
  Pope. &quot;This personage was the monarch of Christendom, something
  analogous to our holy khalifs, who were the heads of Islam and the
  Mohammedan world; and from him the princes of Christendom received
  investiture, as did our Mohammedan sovereigns from the khalifs of
  Bagdad. The ecclesiastics every where gave out that the pontiff was
  the vicegerent of God, and that every one who died without his
  blessing and forgiveness would suffer endless torments hereafter.
  Moreover, if the king of any country did aught contravening the
  Pope&#39;s pleasure, his people were excommunicated, and anathemas
  published against them to the whole of Europe. Thus were the nations
  led by the nose like a string of camels.&quot; He then proceeds to
  state how Henry, by holding forth to his nobles the prospect of
  participation in the rich possessions of the church, induced them to
  join him in the enterprize of destroying the papal ascendency.
  &quot;He then commanded the name of the Pope to be expunged from the
  <i>khotbah</i>, and his own to be substituted as head of the church;
  while the <i>idols</i> and pictures were removed from the churches,
  and not allowed to be again used in worship; and the confiscated
  property was divided into three parts, one of which he reserved for
  himself, the second he gave to the nobles who had assisted him, and
  distributed the third among the clergy of the new or reformed
  religion.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Pope&#39;s wrath was kindled at these proceedings, and he
    excommunicated the king, who trampled the edict under his feet. The
    Pope then wrote to the princes of Christendom, exhorting them all
    to undertake a <i>holy war</i> against Henry, who was not only a
    heretic, but an infidel; adding, that if they did not, fire would
    be rained on them from heaven as a punishment for their neglect.
    Some of the Christian monarchs, as the King of Spain, declared war
    accordingly against Henry, and sent ships to the coast of England;
    but all their attempts failed; and the King of Denmark and other
    potentates, perceiving that the Pope&#39;s threats were not
    accomplished, and that no fire fell <span class='pagenum'><a name=
    "Page_761" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</a></span> from heaven, followed
    Henry&#39;s example in expelling the Pope&#39;s clergy from their
    dominions, and adopted measures of reform similar to his. From this
    time the Pope&#39;s power began to decline in all the countries of
    Europe, so that at the present day his name is read in the
    <i>khotbah</i> only in the city of Rome and the small territory
    which is yet left him in its neighbourhood; and the old practice of
    excommunication seems to have entirely ceased; while the reformed
    religion introduced by Henry, and which is so different from the
    ancient faith, has existed in England ever since, a period of above
    three hundred years.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>We need not pursue further our extracts from the Khan&#39;s
  speculations on English history, of which the passages already given
  afford a sufficient specimen; but we may notice that he mentions
  James I. as the first English monarch who sent an ambassador (Sir
  Thomas Roe) to the court of Delhi, and refers to the history of
  Ferishta for an account of his reception by the Emperor Jehanghir. He
  next proceeds to describe the climate, productions, and statistics of
  the country, its division into <i>zillahs</i> or counties, the law of
  primogeniture as regards succession to landed property, &amp;c.; and
  enters into minute details on the laws regulating the succession to
  the throne, the responsibility of ministers, the election of the
  members of the House of Commons, and the mutual dependence of the
  three branches of the legislature; but his remarks on these subjects,
  though creditable from their general accuracy, possess little
  originality; and may be left without comment for the edification of
  his friends in Hindustan, for whose benefit it is to be presumed they
  were intended. The doctrine of the responsibility of ministers,
  (which the Khan in a former part of his narrative, as we had occasion
  to remark, seemed either to have been unacquainted with, or to have
  lost sight of,) is here stated with a full appreciation of its
  practical bearings; and is pronounced to be &quot;the best law which
  the English ever made for the government of the people, by imposing a
  check on the absolute will of the sovereign; resembling the similar
  restraint on the power of our monarchs which prevails in Islam,
  though with us the check is still more powerful and effectual, as the
  judge is empowered by the Koran to demand satisfaction from the
  sovereign himself!&quot; The details of the British finances are
  briefly touched upon, with a special denunciation of &quot;that most
  extraordinary tax laid on the light of the sun when it comes through
  a window:&quot;&#8212;but the Khan contents himself with stating the
  amount of the national debt, and the interest annually paid to the
  public creditors, without offering any scheme for its extinction,
  like that of his countryman Mirza Abu-Taleb, who with perfect gravity
  and good faith proposes that the fundholders should be summoned
  before Parliament, and informed by the minister, that since the
  pressure of the taxes necessary to meet the interest must inevitably,
  erelong, produce a revolution, in which the whole debt would be
  cancelled, it would be far better for them at once to relinquish with
  a good grace great part of their claim, and accept payment of the
  balance by instalments. Of the feasibility, as well as equity of this
  plan, the Mirza does not appear to entertain the smallest
  doubt:&#8212;&quot;and thus,&quot; he triumphantly concludes,
  &quot;in twenty or thirty years, the whole of the debt would be
  liquidated; some of the most oppressive taxes might be immediately
  abolished, and others gradually relinquished; provisions would become
  cheaper, and the people be rendered happy, and grateful to the
  government.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;When in Hindustan,&quot; says the Khan, &quot;I had heard,
  like millions of others, of something in connexion with the Feringhi
  rulers, called <i>Company</i>; but no one knew whether this was a
  man, or a medicine, or a weapon, or a horse, or a ship, or any thing
  else. The most prevalent notion was, that it was an old woman; but as
  the oldest among us, and their fathers before them, had always heard
  it spoken of in exactly the same terms, they were further puzzled to
  account for her preternatural longevity.&quot; A well-directed course
  of enquiry in England, speedily enabled the Khan to unravel the
  mystery; and he has enlightened his countrymen with full details on
  the composition of the venerable Begum, with the Court of Directors,
  the Board of Control, &amp;c.; but in the prosecution of these
  researches, he was surprised by finding that <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</a></span>
  <i>Company</i> was so far from being one and indivisible, that
  <i>Companies</i> &quot;exist by thousands for multifarious
  objects&#8212;many even for speculation in human life. The most
  recent is the Victoria, composed of twelve directors, and other
  officers. A man puts a value on his life, and on this sum they put a
  per centage, varying according to his age and state of health, which
  he pays, and when he dies his heirs receive the money. People of the
  middle classes generally resort to this method of providing, by small
  annual contributions, for the support of their families after their
  decease&#8212;and consequently the man&#39;s own relations often
  rejoice when he dies, while strangers (the Insurance Company)
  grieve.&quot;</p>

  <p>On the important subject of the domestic usages and manners of the
  English, the Khan enters less at length than might have been
  expected. Of country life, indeed, from which alone correct ideas on
  such subjects can be derived, he saw absolutely nothing, his
  knowledge of the country being apparently limited to the prospect
  from the windows of a railway carriage; and his acquaintance with
  London manners was drawn more from ballrooms and crowded soirÃ©es,
  than from the private circles of family rÃ©unions. With these limited
  opportunities of observation, his remarks on the mass of the people
  are necessarily confined, in a great measure, to their outdoor
  habits; in which nothing appears to have surprised him more than the
  small number of horsemen (as he considers) to be seen in the streets
  of London; &quot;the generality of these, too, are extremely bad
  riders, though this, perhaps, may be owing to the uncouth and awkward
  saddles they use:&quot; a libel on our national character for
  horsemanship, into which we must charitably hope that the Cockney
  cavaliers who crowd the Regent&#39;s Park on Sundays, are responsible
  for having misled him. The important point of the comparative
  deference paid to women, and the amount of liberty and privileges
  enjoyed by them, in the social systems of Mohammedan and Christian
  countries respectively, is taken up by the Khan in behalf of the
  former, with as much warmth as in past years by his compatriot Mirza
  Abu-Taleb,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and in much the same line
  of argument&#8212;to the effect that the dowery which the eastern
  husband is bound by law to pay over in money to his wife in the event
  of a separation, is a far more effectual protection to the wife from
  the fickleness and caprice of her partner, (&quot;whose
  <i>interest</i> it thus becomes, setting affection wholly out of the
  question, to remain on good terms with her,&quot;) than any remedy
  afforded by the laws of England; where a wife, though bound by ties
  less easily dissolved than under the Mohammedan system of divorces,
  may still be driven, without misconduct on her part, from her
  husband&#39;s house, and left to seek redress by the slow process of
  litigation. The Khan assures us that several ladies with whom he
  conversed on these interesting topics, and who had passed many years
  of their lives in India, were utterly unacquainted with these
  protective rights of Hindustani wives; and were obliged to confess,
  that if they were correctly stated, &quot;the ladies in India are far
  better off than ourselves. For (said they) the dowery we receive from
  our fathers on our marriage goes to our husbands, who may squander it
  in one day if they like; and even the dresses we wear are not our own
  property, but are given us by our husbands.&quot; But if we allow the
  Khan all due credit for the adroitness and success with which he
  maintained on this occasion the cause of his fair countrywomen, we
  can scarcely acquit him of something like disingenuousness in a
  discussion with &quot;another lady,&quot; apparently one who had
  <i>not</i> been in India, and who lamented the hard fate (as she
  believed) of the Indian widows, who could not marry again after the
  death of their first husband, and were at the mercy of the priests,
  who filled their heads with terrors of a future state to prevent
  their doing so. &quot;With regard to this last idea, it is so utterly
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[Pg
  763]</a></span> groundless, that there is no word in our language
  corresponding with &#39;priest;&#39; and of all religions in the
  world, Islam is the least influenced by spiritual meddlers of any
  sort. It is, besides, expressly enjoined in the Koran, that widows
  should marry; they may do so as often as they like, if they survive
  their husbands; and if they do not, it is their own choice.&quot;
  Now, though this vehement denial of the Khan&#39;s is perfectly true
  as regards <i>Moslem</i> law and <i>Moslem</i> widows, he must have
  been well aware that the lady&#39;s error arose from her considering
  as common to all the natives of India, Hindustanis as well as Hindus,
  those customs and restrictions which are peculiar to the Hindus
  alone. Among the latter, as is well known, both the priestcraft of
  the Brahmins, and the impediments to the marriage of a widow,<a name=
  "FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
  class="fnanchor">[20]</a> exist in full force at this day; and it
  would have been more candid on the part of the Khan, even at the
  expense of a little of his Moslem pride, to have set his fair
  opponent right on these points, than to have triumphed over her
  ignorance, without showing her wherein lay her error.</p>

  <p>But however deeply the Khan may have commiserated the unprotected
  condition of English wives, as compared with the security of rights
  enjoyed by the more fortunate dames of Hindustan, we find him at all
  times disposed to do ample justice to the social qualifications and
  accomplishments of our countrywomen, and the beneficial influence
  exercised by them in smoothing the asperities of society. The
  masculine portion of the community, indeed, find little favour in the
  eyes of the Khan, who accuses them of being prone to indulge in
  inveterate enmity and ill-feeling on slight grounds, while instances
  of real friendship, on the contrary, are extremely rare: and he is
  wearied and disgusted by the endless disputes which occur at all
  times and all places, from the collision of individuals of adverse
  political sentiments. &quot;They dispute in parliament, they dispute
  in their social circles, they dispute in steam-boats, on railroads,
  in eating and drinking; and I verily believe that, but for some
  slight feeling of religion, they would dispute even in their
  churches. But in the same proportion as the men were hostile to each
  other, did the women seem united: the more there were of these fair
  creatures, the pleasanter did they make the party by their smiles and
  good-humour: with the men, the more there were collected together,
  the more wrangling always ensued. In qualities of the mind and heart,
  as well as in the social virtues, the women far surpass the
  men&#8212;they are more susceptible of friendship, more hospitable to
  strangers, less reserved, and, I must say, generally better informed.
  Wherever I have been conversing with gentlemen in society, if a
  difficulty occurred on any topic, the men would invariably turn to
  their wives or sisters, and ask for an explanation, thus tacitly
  admitting the superior attainments of the ladies: and I have always
  found that I obtained from the latter a more satisfactory answer to
  any of my enquiries on national customs and institutions. Nor must it
  be supposed that this superiority was only apparent, and arose from
  the desire the men might have to display the accomplishments of their
  ladies by referring so constantly to them: it is the real state of
  the case, as far as I can judge from the manners of the
  people.&quot;</p>

  <p>We cannot better close our extracts from the Khan&#39;s remarks on
  English manners and society, than with this spontaneous tribute to
  the merits and attractions of our countrywomen, the value of which is
  enhanced by its coming, as it does, from an acute observer of a
  social system in which every thing was wholly at variance with his
  preconceived habits and ideas, and from one, moreover, totally
  unacquainted with that routine of compliment, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</a></span> which
  serves gentlemen in the regions of Franguestan, to use the words of
  Die Vernon, &quot;like the toys and beads which navigators carry with
  them to propitiate the inhabitants of newly-discovered lands.&quot;
  But the impression produced on the Khan by the contemplation of the
  institutions and resources of England has yet to be viewed in another
  light&#8212;in its relations to the government of India under
  Feringhi rule, and the comparative benefits conferred on the people
  at large, by the sway respectively of the English, and of their old
  Mohammedan rulers. The Khan&#39;s opinions on these subjects will
  doubtless be read with surprise by that numerous and respectable
  class of the community, who hold as an article of faith, (to use the
  words of our author,) that in Mohammedan countries &quot;every prince
  is a tyrant; every court of justice full of corruption; and all the
  people sunk in depravity, ignorance, and misery:&quot; and who cling
  to the comfortable delusion that we have succeeded, by the equity of
  our civil government, in attaching to our rule the population of
  India. As a view of this important subject <i>from the other side of
  the question</i>, taken by one, however, by no means indisposed to do
  justice to what he considers as the meritorious features of the
  English administration, the Khan&#39;s comparative summary, though
  not wholly devoid of prejudice, possesses considerable interest: and
  it must be admitted, that with respect to the internal improvement of
  the country, his strictures have hitherto had but too much
  foundation, though the schemes of the present governor-general, if
  carried into effect, will go far to remove the stigma from the
  Anglo-Indian rulers. After contrasting, in a conversation with an
  English friend, the expedition of legal proceedings under the Moslem
  rule, with the slow process of the English courts in India, to be
  finally remedied only by the endless and generally ineffectual course
  of appeal to the privy-council at home, (in which, according to the
  Khan&#39;s statement, not a single individual of the number who have
  undertaken the long voyage from India has ever succeeded,) he
  proceeds&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Historical facts seem to be wholly lost sight of by those
  who talk of the conduct of Mohammedan rulers in India, who, as I
  could prove by many instances, were constantly solicitous of the
  happiness of their subjects. Shah-Jehan constructed a road from Delhi
  to Lahore, a distance of 500 miles, with guard-houses at intervals of
  every three miles, and at every ten or twelve miles a caravanserai,
  where all travellers were fed and lodged at the Emperor&#39;s
  expense. Besides this, canals were dug, and public edifices built, at
  the expense of millions, without taxing the people to pay for them as
  here; and these edifices still stand, and will endure for many years,
  as monuments of the munificence of the monarchs who erected them.
  During the seventy years of the English dominion in India, what has
  been done which would remind the people fifty years hence, if they
  should retire from the country, that such a nation had ever held sway
  there? The only memorials they would leave, would be the numerous
  empty bottles scattered over the whole empire, to indicate what has
  been done <i>in</i>, if not <i>for</i> India! In some cases also,
  they have squandered millions without benefit either to the people or
  themselves. The money spent in three years on the insane war in
  Cabul, if expended on the construction of railroads or canals, or the
  extension of steam navigation on our great rivers, would have
  employed thousands of men for twenty years, returned an immense
  profit to government, and have gained them a good name among the
  people. But it is the misfortune of India, that notwithstanding the
  high qualities of energy and enterprise, united with superior
  education and intelligence, unquestionably possessed by its masters,
  they display so lamentable and apathetic an indifference to the
  amelioration of the country. Since I have had such opportunities of
  observing the proofs of English art and skill which I see every where
  and in every department, I cannot but the more deeply regret that
  these wonderful discoveries, and strange and unheard-of inventions,
  in every branch of science and art, are likely to remain unknown to
  the people of India. If I were to relate on my return all the wonders
  I have seen, no one would believe me: and to what could I appeal in
  evidence of the truth of what I say? Are there any establishments
  where these things can be shown to the people on <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</a></span> any
  thing like an adequate scale? If such institutions had been
  established, the people would have some tangible proof of the real
  intellectual superiority of their English rulers: but in the lapse of
  seventy years, nothing has been done. Again, if seminaries had been
  founded on the principle of those built and endowed by the emperors,
  they might have produced men eminent in various faculties: but though
  it is true that schools were built by the Company some fifteen years
  since, in various parts of the empire, in which some thousands of
  children, both Hindoo and Moslem, have received education, they have
  never turned out a single man of superior attainments in any
  department of literature there taught:&#8212;and it is remarkable
  that not an instance exists, as far as I am aware, of a man thus
  educated in the Company&#39;s own schools having been selected for
  the high judicial offices of <i>Sadr-ameen</i>, and principal
  <i>Sadr-ameen</i> (judges in the local courts;) but that these
  functionaries have invariably been chosen from those educated in the
  native method. Is not this strange, that Government should have
  established schools professing to give superior instruction to the
  people; and that not one so trained should have been found eligible
  to fill any of the judicial or fiscal offices of their own
  government? and how can it be accounted for, except by these
  institutions having been conducted on an erroneous principle? When I
  return to India, I must be like the free-masons, silent and reserved,
  unless when I meet one who has been, like myself, in England, and
  with whom I can converse on the wonders we have both witnessed in
  that marvellous country, and which, if I venture to narrate them in
  public, or even among my own immediate friends and relatives, would
  draw on me such disbelief, that I would certainly die from grief of
  heart.&quot;&#8212;Here leave we Kerim Khan; not without a hope, that
  in spite of the apprehensions expressed in the passage just quoted,
  of incurring the reproach to which &quot;travellers&#39; tales&quot;
  are supposed to be sometimes obnoxious, he has not eventually
  persisted in withholding from his countrymen a narrative which, both
  from the opportunities of observation enjoyed by the writer, and the
  ability and good judgement with which he has availed himself of these
  advantages, is better calculated to dispel the incredulity which he
  anticipates, than the Travels of Mirza Abu-Taleb, (the text of which
  has been printed at Calcutta,) or indeed than any work with which we
  are acquainted. Trusting, then, that the Khan&#39;s patriotic
  aspirations for the welfare of his country may be realized by the
  speedy introduction of all those Feringhi appendages to high
  civilization, the want of which he so feelingly deplores, and that he
  may live a thousand years in the full fruition of all the advantages
  therefrom resulting, we now take leave of him.</p>

  <h3>BY JOSEPH DOWNES.</h3>

  <h3>Author of &quot;The Mountain Decameron.&quot;</h3>

  <h4>Llangaddock, Carmarthenshire, September 9.</h4>

  <p>&quot;And this is the &#39;<i>disturbed
  district!</i>&#39;&#8212;this is the seat of war!&#8212;the
  &#39;<i>Agrarian civil war!</i>&#39;&#8212;the headquarters of the
  &#39;<i>Rebecca rebels!</i>&quot; I soliloquized, about the hour of
  one A.M. on the night of September 9, 1843&#8212;a night of more than
  summer beauty, sultry and light as day&#8212;while thrusting my head
  from the window of &quot;mine inn&quot; the Castle, in this pretty
  picturesque little village-town, to coin a term. The shadows of the
  rustic houses, and interspersed corn-stacks, trees, and orchards,
  stretched across the irregular street, without a causeway, in
  unbroken quiet; not a sound was heard but the voice of an owl from a
  &quot;fold&quot; in the very heart of &quot;the town,&quot; and the
  low murmur of the river chafing against the buttresses of an antique
  bridge at the end of the said &quot;street;&quot; while an humble bow
  window of a shop, where at nightfall I had observed some dozens of
  watches (<i>silver</i>, too!) displayed, without a token of
  &quot;Rebecca&quot; terrorism appearing, was seen jutting into the
  road, only hidden, not defended, by such a weak apology for a
  shutter, as would not have resisted a burglar of ten years&#39;
  old.</p>

  <p>It was now Sunday morning, and the clean-swept neatness of the
  sleeping village, whose inhabitants we had seen busily engaged in
  this pleasing preparation for the day of rest, as we strolled there
  at twilight, confirmed the assurance of profound and fearless peace;
  for only in that happy condition of society could the mind be
  supposed disengaged enough to regard those minute decencies of rural
  English life. With a smile of well-pleased wonder at the
  exaggerations of the press, which were persuading the Londoners that
  the &quot;dogs of war&quot; were really &quot;let slip&quot; among
  these our green mountains and pastoral valleys, after enjoying this
  prospect of a village by moonlight at the foot of the majestic
  <i>Mynydd Du</i>, (black mountain,) whose range is seen by day,
  towering at a few miles&#39; distance, and hugging myself in the
  security of life and purse, which warriors (if they would
  cross-question their own great hearts) do really prize as much as I
  do, I returned to bed, (the heat of which had first driven me forth
  to this air-bath of half an hour.) &quot;And <i>this</i> is the seat
  of insurrection!&quot; I reiterated sarcastically against all English
  and all Welsh purveyors of &quot;news&quot; for terror-loving
  readers.</p>

  <p>I have a huge deal of patriotism in my composition&#8212;also, a
  great love of rural quiet, joined to some <i>trifling</i> degree of
  cowardice, as my family pretend; but that I impute to my
  over-familiarity with them. &quot;No man is great to his valet,&quot;
  has been remarked. The domestics of Alexander wondered what the world
  found to wonder at, in the little man their master. However this may
  be, I confess it was very pleasant to me to find peace unbroken in
  these my old haunts. Here I had many a summer night enacted, as
  recorded in my &quot;Mountain Decameron,&quot; the amateur-gipsy,
  &quot;a long while ago,&quot; <i>bivouacking</i> in their wildest
  solitudes, between some wood and water, on moonlight greensward, or
  reading at our tents&#39; mouth by a lamp, while two boys, my sons,
  slept soundly within; and in the blindness of human nature, thus
  sneering against the &quot;gentlemen of the press,&quot; sneered
  myself to sleep, &quot;shut up in measureless content.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Most lame and impotent conclusion!&quot; The peace of nature
  in that sweet night was weak assurance of any kindred feeling in the
  bosom of man. It so happened (as I afterwards learned) that
  felony&#8212;<i>bloody</i> felony&#8212;was at that very time busy,
  at no great distance; that murder, that arson in its direst
  character, were stamping their first damnable characters on a
  province noted, through ages, for innocence and simple piety; that
  the first victim to rebellion was, at that moment, bleeding to death
  under the hands of those wearing the shapes of men; that victim
  innocent, helpless, and&#8212;a woman!!</p>

  <p>But of this in the course of my narrative. Sunday, September
  10.</p>

  <p>As I proceeded from Llangaddock this afternoon, in company with my
  son, we found no slackness in the attendance on the chapels, which
  keep rising in all directions in the principality. The groups issuing
  from them, survey us with surly eyes, as <i>Sabbath-breakers</i>, for
  travelling on the &quot;Lord&#39;s day.&quot; It is curious to
  reflect that these very persons who have just been listening to the
  preachers of a gospel of peace, with white upturning eyes and inward
  groans, who present countenances deeply marked, as it seems to us,
  with the spirit of severe sanctity, betrayed by their sour looks at
  us, and not rarely vested in two or three expressions <i>at</i> us
  among themselves&#8212;I say, how curious a fact in the
  <i>pathology</i> of minds does it present, that these very men will
  (some of them) reappear in a few hours, or days, in the characters of
  <i>felons</i>, midnight rebels to law and order, redressing minor
  wrongs committed by a few against themselves, by a tenfold fouler
  wrong against all men, against society itself. For a <i>system</i>
  which consists in defying the laws, is a systematic waging of war
  against the very element that binds men in society&#8212;it is a
  casting off of civilization, a return to miserable dependence on
  animal strength alone, on brutish cunning, or midnight hiding in the
  dark, for all we enjoy. It seems well known that the farmers
  themselves are the Rebeccaites, aided by their servants, and that
  <i>the</i> Rebecca is no other than some forward booby, or worse
  character, who ambitiously claims to <i>act</i> the leader, under the
  unmanly disguise of a female, yielding his post in turn to other such
  petticoat heros. The &quot;Rebecca&quot; seems no more than a living
  figure to give <i>effect</i> to the drama, as boys dress up an effigy
  and parade it as <i>the</i> Guy Fawkes.</p>

  <p>It is curious to witness the chop-fallen aspect of the poor
  toll-collectors. The &quot;looking for&quot; of a dark hour is
  depicted on the <i>female</i> faces, at least, and a certain
  constrained civility mixed with sullenness, marks the manners of the
  male portion near large towns; for elsewhere, humble civility has
  <i>always</i> met the traveller in this class of Welsh cottagers. The
  frequent appearance of dragoons, the clatter of their dangling
  accoutrements of war, and grotesque ferocity of hairy headgear, and
  mock-heroic air of superiority to the more quietly grotesque groups
  of grey-coated men, and muffled up Welsh women gives a new feature to
  our tour in this hitherto tranquil region, where a soldier used to be
  a monster that men, women, children, all alike, would run to the
  cottage door to look at. A very different sort of look than that of
  childish curiosity now greets these gallant warriors, at least from
  the farmers. &quot;&#39;Becca&quot; is the beloved of their secret
  hearts&#8212;&#39;Becca has already given them roads without paying
  for them! &#39;Becca is longed for by every <i>honest</i> farmer of
  them all, whenever he pays a toll-gate. And these fellows are come
  sword in hand, to hunt down poor innocent &#39;Becca! Well may the
  Welshman&#39;s eyes lower on them, whatever may be the looks of the
  Welsh women.</p>

  <p>We have now rode through several toll-gates, the ruins of the
  toll-houses only remaining, and rode scatheless! No toll
  asked&#8212;no darting forth of a grim figure from his little castle,
  at the shake of the road by tramp of horses&#8212;like the spider
  showing himself at his hole, on the trembling of his web to the
  struggle of a luckless fly. Nothing appeared but a shell of a house,
  with blackened remains of rafters, or a great heap of stones, not
  even a wall left&#8212;and huge stumps of gate-posts, and not a hand
  extended, or voice raised to demand payment for our use of a
  road!&#8212;that payment which the laws of the land had formally
  pronounced due! Had new laws been passed? Had a new mode arisen of
  discharging the debt we had incurred by the purchase of the use of so
  much road for two horses? Nothing of the kind! A mob at midnight had
  thrown down the barrier law had built; and law dared not, or
  neglected to&#8212;erect it again! &quot;Rebecca,&quot; like Jack
  Cade, had pronounced <i>her</i> law&#8212;&quot;sic volo, sic
  jubeo&quot;&#8212;and we rode through, by virtue of her most
  graceless Majesty&#39;s absolute edict&#8212;cost free. It was really
  a very singular feeling we experienced on the first of these
  occasions. I assure thee, my reader; believe me, my pensive public! I
  never was transported&#8212;never held up hand at the Old Bailey, or
  elsewhere; am not conscious of any sinister sort of projections about
  my skull that phrenologists <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_768"
  id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span> might draw ugly conclusions on; yet
  I confess, that after an eloquent burst of Conservative wrath against
  this strange triumph of anarchy&#8212;after looking down on these
  works of mob law, unreversed, tamely endured&#8212;after fancying I
  saw the prostrate genius of social order there lying
  helpless&#8212;the dethroned majesty of British law there grovelling
  among the black ruins, insulted, unrestored&#8212;left to be trampled
  over with insolent laughter, by refractory boors, ignorant as savages
  of that law&#39;s inestimable blessing&#8212;I say, after all these
  hurried thoughts and feelings&#8212;let me whisper thee, my reader,
  that a certain scandalous pleasure <i>did</i> creep up from these
  finger-ends, instinctively groping the pocket for the pre-doomed
  &quot;thrippence,&quot; yea, quite up to this lofty, reasoning, and
  right loyal sensorium, on leaving the said sum in good and lawful
  money, snug and safe in my own pocket, instead of handing it over to
  a toll collector. Let us not expect too much from poor human nature!
  I defy any man&#8212;Aristides Redivivus himself, to ride <i>toll
  free</i> through, or rather over, a turnpike defunct in this manner,
  and not feel a pernicious pleasure at his heart, a sort of slyly
  triumphing satisfaction, spite of himself, as of a dog that gets his
  adversary undermost; in short&#8212;without becoming for the moment,
  under the Circean chink of the saved &quot;coppers,&quot; a rank
  Rebeccaite! The Lord and the law forgive me, for I surely loved
  &#39;Becca at <i>heart</i> at that moment!</p>

  <p>My son being a young man about returning to college, it was highly
  important to conceal this backsliding within; so I launched out the
  more upon the monster character of this victory of brawny ignorance
  and stupid rebellion over the spirit of laws&#8212;but it
  wouldn&#39;t do. &quot;But you don&#39;t <i>look</i> altogether so
  angry about it as you speak, father,&quot; said he, though what he
  could see to betray any inward chuckling, I am not aware. If the
  casual saving of a toll could thus operate upon ME, who should,
  perhaps, never pass there again, can it be wondered at that farmers,
  to whom this triumph must prove a great annual gain, are Rebeccaites
  <i>to the backbone</i>, and to a man? I fear they must be more than
  man, not to cry secretly to this levelling lady &quot;God
  speed!&quot; And this leads me to more serious reflection on the
  incomprehensible and fatal conduct of the local authorities <i>in the
  first instance</i>, in not <i>instantly</i> re-erecting the
  toll-gates, or fixing chains <i>pro tempore</i>, protecting at
  whatever expense some persons to demand compliance with the laws,
  that not for a week, a day, an hour, the disgraceful and dangerous
  spectacle should be exhibited, of authority completely down-trodden,
  law successfully defied. Surely the first step in vindication of the
  dignity of legal supremacy could not be difficult. By day, at least,
  surely a constabulary force might have compelled obedience. A few
  military at <i>first</i>, stationed near the gates, would have awed
  rustic rebels. It is the <i>impunity</i> which this unheard-of palsy
  of the governing strong hand so long ensured to them, which has
  fostered riot into rebellion, and rebellion into incendiarism and
  murder. Is it possible for a thinking man to see these poor and
  (truth to tell) most money-loving people, saving two or three
  shillings every time they drive their team to market or lime, by the
  prostration of a gate, and be at a loss to discover the secret of
  this midnight work spreading like wildfire? Why, every transit which
  a farmer makes cost free, is a spur to his avarice, a tribute of
  submission to his lawless will, a temptation to his ignorant
  impatience of <i>all</i> payments to try his hand against all. The
  quiet acquiescence in refusal to pay&#8212;the vanishing of
  toll-house and toll-takers without one magisterial edict&#8212;the
  mere submission to the mob, seems to cry &quot;<i>peccavi</i>&quot;
  too manifestly, and affords fresh colour to indiscriminate
  condemnation of all. A <i>bonus</i> in the shape of a toll for horse
  or team remitted, is thus actually presented, many times a-day, to
  the rioter, the rebel, the midnight incendiary of toll-houses, for
  this good work, by the supine, besotted, or fear-palsied local
  authorities. Shall a man look on while a burglar enters his house,
  ransacks his till, let him depart, and then, in despair, leave the
  door he broke open, open still all night for his entrance, and then
  wonder that burglary is vastly on the increase? The wonder, I think,
  is that one gate remains; and that wonder will not exist long, if
  government do not do something more than send down <i>a</i> gentleman
  to ask the Welsh what they please to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span> want? The temptation
  forced upon the eyes and minds of a poverty-stricken and greedy
  people, by this shocking spectacle of the mastery of anarchy over
  order, in the annihilation of an impost by armed mountain peasants,
  is in itself a great cruelty; for in all Agrarian risings the state
  has triumphed at last, inasmuch as wealth and its resources are an
  over-match for poverty, however furious or savage; hence blood will
  flow under the sword of justice ultimately, which early vigilance on
  her part might have wholly spared. &quot;Knock down that
  toll-house&#8212;fire its contents&#8212;murder its tenant,&quot;
  seems the voice of such sleepy justice to pronounce, &quot;and
  neither I, nor my myrmidons will even <i>ask</i> you again for toll!
  Do this, and you shall not pay!!&quot;</p>

  <p>Such was the tacit invitation kindly presented by the <i>first</i>
  torn down toll-gate that remained in ruins, to every Welsh farmer.
  The farmer has accepted it, and &quot;justice&quot;&#8212;justice
  keeps her promise religiously, for no toll is demanded. If the law
  had been violated by trustees, we have a body called parliament
  strong enough to reform, ay, and punish them, as they, some of them
  perhaps, richly deserve; but was that a reason for the laws to be
  annulled, and lawlessness made the order of the day, in so important
  a matter as public roads, by the very men who are to profit by it,
  self-erected into judges in their own cause?</p>

  <h4>Llandilo Vaur. Evening, Sept. 10. Sunday.</h4>

  <p>A scene to turn even a &quot;commercial traveller&quot;
  (<i>vulgo</i> a bagman) into a &quot;sentimental&quot; one, if any
  thing could! Clouds that had overcast our ride of the last few miles,
  kindly &quot;flew diverse&quot; as we reached the bridge over the
  Towey, that flows at the foot of the declivity on which this romantic
  town stands. The sun broke forth, and all at once showed, and
  burnished while it showed, one of the noblest landscapes in South
  Wales&#8212;not the less attractive for being that which kindled the
  muse of Dyer&#8212;on which the saintly eye of a far greater poet had
  often reposed&#8212;the immortal <i>prose-poet</i> bishop, Jeremy
  Taylor, a refugee here during the storm of the Civil Wars. Golden
  Grove, his beautiful retreat, with its venerable trees, was in our
  sight, the green mountain meadows between literally verifying its
  name by the brilliance of their sunshiny rich grass, where &quot;God
  had showered the landscape;&quot; to a fantastic fancy, giving the
  idea of the quivering of the richest leaf gold on a ground of
  emerald. The humbler Welsh Parnassus of the painter poet, Grongar
  Hill, towered also in distance. We traced the pastoral yet noble
  river, winding away in long meanders, up-flashing silver, through a
  broad mountain valley, dotted with white farms, rich in various
  foliage, marked as a map by lines, with well-marked hedge-rows;
  harvest fields full of sheaves, yellowing all the lofty slopes that
  presented these beautiful farms and folds full to the descending sun;
  those slopes, surmounted by grand masses of darkness, solemnly
  contrasted with the gay luxuriance all below; that darkness only the
  shade of woods, nodding like the black plume over the golden armour
  of some giant hero of fable, &quot;magna componere parvis.&quot;</p>

  <p>Nearer, rose directly from the river a noble park, with all the
  charm of the wild picturesque, from its antique look, its romantic
  undulations and steepness, its woody mount and ivied ruin of a
  castle, &quot;bosomed high in tufted trees,&quot; half-hidden, yet
  visible and reflected in the now-placid mirror of a reach of the
  river.</p>

  <p>Being Sunday, a moral charm was added to those of this exquisite
  natural panorama, from which the curtain of storm-cloud seemed just
  then drawn up, as if to strike us the more with its flashing glory of
  sunshine, water, and a whole sky become cerulean in a few minutes. No
  Sabbath bells chimed, indeed; but the hushed town, and vacant groups
  come abroad to enjoy the return of that Italian weather we had long
  luxuriated in, impressed, equally with any music, the idea of Sabbath
  on the mind. It was hard to believe, revolting to be forced to
  believe, that this fine scene of perfect beauty and deep repose, as
  presented to the eye, directed to nature only&#8212;to the mind&#39;s
  eye rolling up to nature&#39;s God&#8212;was also the (newly
  transfigured) theatre of man&#39;s worst and darkest passions; that
  the <i>army</i>&#8212;that odious, hideous, necessary curse of
  civilization, the severe and hateful guardian of liberty and peace,
  (though uncongenial to both)&#8212;was at that moment <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</a></span> evoked
  by all the lovers of both for their salvation; was even then
  violating the ideal harmony of the hour, by its foul yet saving
  presence; was parading those green suburbs, and the sweet fields
  under those mountain walls, with those clangours so discordant to the
  holy influences of the hour and scene&#8212;emerging in their gay,
  shocking costume, (the colour of blood, and devised for its
  concealment,) from angles of rocks, and mouths of bowered avenues,
  where the mild fugitive from civil war, and faithful devotee of his
  throneless king, had often wandered, meditating on &quot;Holy
  Dying&quot;&#8212;of &quot;Holy Living&quot; himself a beautiful
  example&#8212;where even still, nothing gave outward and visible sign
  of incendiarism and murder lurking among those hermitages of rustic
  life; yet were both in active, secret operation!</p>

  <p>In that very park of <i>Dynevor</i>, whose beauty we were admiring
  from the bridge, a little walk would have led us to&#8212;a
  <i>grave!</i>&#8212;no consecrated one, but one dug ready to receive
  a corpse; <i>dug, in savage threatening of slaughter, for the
  reception of one yet living</i>&#8212;the son of the noble owner of
  that ancient domain&#8212;dug in sight of his father&#39;s house, in
  his own park, by wretches who have warned him to prepare to fill that
  grave in October! The gentleman so threatened, being void of all
  offence save that of being a magistrate&#8212;a sworn preserver of
  the public peace!</p>

  <p>Equally abhorrent to rational piety, if less shocking, is that air
  of sourest sanctity which the groups now passing us bring with them
  out from the meeting-houses.</p>

  <p>Ask a question, and a nasal noise between groan and snort seems to
  signify that they ask to be asked again, a sort of
  <i>ha&#8212;a&#8212;h?</i> &quot;long drawn out.&quot; The human face
  and the face of nature, at that hour, were as an east of thunder
  fronting a west of golden blue summer serenity. The Mawworms of
  Calvinistic Methodism have made a sort of monkery of all Wales, as
  regards externals at least. To think a twilight or noonday walk for
  pleasure a sin, involves the absurdest principle of ascetic folly, as
  truly as self-flagellation, or wearing horsehair shirts. Not that
  these ministers set their flocks any example of self-mortification.
  The greater number of preachers show excellent &quot;condition,&quot;
  the poorest farmers&#39; wives vying with each other in purveying
  &quot;creature comforts&quot; for these spiritual comforters.
  Preparing hot dinners, it seems, is not working on the Lord&#39;s Day
  when it is for the preacher; though to save a field of corn, which is
  in danger of being spoiled if left out, as in some seasons, would be
  a shocking desecration of that day. Yet, to observe the abstracted
  unearthly carriage of these men, who seem &quot;conversing with the
  skies&quot; while walking the streets, one wonders at the contrast of
  such burly bodies and refined spirits.</p>

  <p>To return to the flock from these burly shepherds of
  souls&#8212;this outbreak of a devilish spirit&#8212;this crusade
  against law and order, tolls and tithes, life and property, is a
  damning evidence against these spiritual pastors and masters, for
  such they are to the great body of the Welsh common people, in the
  fullest sense. The <i>Times</i> newspaper has ruffled the whole
  &quot;Volscian&quot; camp of Dissent, it appears, by thundering forth
  against them a charge of inciting their congregations to midnight
  crime. &quot;John Joneses, and David Reeses, and Ap Shenkinses, have
  sprung up like the men from the dragon&#39;s teeth, to repel this
  charge. It is probable that it was not well founded, for the simple
  reason, that such daring subornation of crime would have brought
  <i>themselves</i> into trouble. But what sort of defence is this,
  even if substantiated? You did not <i>excite</i> your followers to
  rebellion and arson! <i>You</i>, with your unlimited command of their
  minds, and almost bodies, why did you not allay, resist, put down the
  excitement, by whomever raised? That is the gravamen of the charge
  against you! You who make then weep, make then tremble, puff them
  with spiritual conceit, or depress them with terrors of damnation
  just as you please, how comes it that you are powerless all at once
  in deterring them from wild and bad actions&#8212;you, who are
  all-powerful in inciting them to any thing, since to refrain from
  violence is easier than to commit it?</p>

  <p>The increase of these outrages proves, that not the power, but
  will, is wanting on your part, to put down this spirit of revenge and
  revolt. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg
  771]</a></span> You perceive the current of their ignorant minds
  setting strongly in toward rapine and rebellion, (the <i>feeler</i>
  put forth being the toll grievance,) and you basely, wickedly, pander
  to their passions, by a discreet silence in your rostra, an
  unchristian apathy; while deeds are being done under your very
  eyes&#8212;in your daily path&#8212;which no good man can view
  without horror; no bold good man in the position which you hold, of
  public instructors in human duties, could see, without denouncing!
  And as your boldness, at least, is pretty apparent, whatever your
  goodness may be, other motives than fear must be sought for this
  unaccountable suspension of your influence&#8212;and I find it in
  <i>self-interest</i>&#8212;love of &quot;filthy lucre.&quot; You are
  &quot;supported by voluntary contribution,&quot; and to thwart the
  passions of your followers, and stem the tide of lawless violence,
  though your most sacred spiritual duty, is not the way to
  conciliate&#8212;is not compatible with that &quot;voluntary
  principle&quot; on which your bread depends, and which too often
  places your duty and your interest in direct opposition.&quot;</p>

  <h4>Llanon, Carmarthenshire.</h4>

  <p>The good woman of our inn in this village has just been
  apologizing for the almost empty state of her house, the furniture
  being chiefly sent away to Pembree, whither she and her family hoped
  to follow in a few days. The cause of her removal was <i>fear of the
  house being set fire to</i>, it being the property of Mr Chambers, a
  magistrate of Llanelly, and the &quot;Rebecca&#39;s company&quot; had
  warned all his tenants to be prepared for their fiery vengeance. His
  heinous offence was heading the police in discharge of his duty, in a
  conflict that has just occurred at Pontardulais gate, near this
  place, in which some of the &#39;Beccaites were wounded. [Since this,
  farm-houses and other property of this gentleman have been consumed,
  his life has been threatened, and his family have prevailed on him to
  abandon his home and native place.] The wounded men, now prisoners,
  were of this village, the <i>focus</i> of this rebellion that dares
  not face the day. It is here that the murderous midnight attack was
  made on the house of a Mr Edwards, when the wretches fired volleys at
  the windows, where his wife and daughter appeared <i>at their
  command</i>. They escaped, miraculously it might be said,
  notwithstanding. The poor old hostess complained, as well she might,
  of the hardship of being thus put in peril, purely in hostility to
  her landlord. We slept, however, soundly, and found ourselves alive
  in the morning; whether through evangelical Rebecca&#39;s scruples
  about burning us out (or <i>in</i>) on a &quot;Lord&#39;s Day&quot;
  night, or her being engaged elsewhere, we knew not.</p>

  <p>And here also we rode through a crowd, murmuring hymns, pouring
  from the chapel, where, no doubt, they had heard some edifying
  discourse about the &quot;sweet Jesus,&quot; and &quot;sweet
  experiences,&quot; and &quot;new birth,&quot; the omnipotence of
  faith to salvation, and all and every topic but a <i>man&#39;s</i>
  just indignation, and a religious man&#39;s most solemn denunciation
  against the bloody and felonious outrages just committed by those
  very villagers&#8212;against the night-masked assassins, who had just
  before wantonly pointed deadly weapons against unoffending
  women&#8212;against the chamber of a sick man, a husband, and a
  father!</p>

  <h4>Llanelly, Sept. 11, Monday.</h4>

  <p>The headquarters of vindictive rebellion, arson, and spiritual
  oratory! An ugly populous town near the sea, now in a ferment of
  mixed fear and fury, from recent savage acts of the Rebeccaites
  against a most respectable magistrate, resident in the town, Mr W.
  Chambers, jun., the denounced landlord of our old Welsh hostess at
  Llanon. Two of his farm-houses have been burned to the ground, and
  his life has been threatened. His grievous offence I stated before.
  Soldiers are seen every where; and verily, the mixture of
  brute-ignorance and brute-ferocity, depicted in the faces of the
  great mass of &quot;operatives&quot; that we meet, seem to hint that
  their presence is not prematurely invoked. Their begrimed features
  and figures, caused by their various employments, give greater effect
  to the wild character of the coatless groups, who, in their blue
  check shirt-sleeves, congregate at every corner to <i>cabal</i>,
  rather than to <i>dispute</i>, it seems; for, fond as they are of
  dissent, (though not one in fifty could tell you <i>from</i> what
  they dissent, or <i>to</i> what they cleave in doctrine,) there seems
  no leaning to dissent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_772" id=
  "Page_772">[Pg 772]</a></span> from the glorious new Rebecca law of
  might (or midnight surprisals) against right.</p>

  <p>In this neighbourhood, our Welsh annals will have to
  record&#8212;<i>the first dwelling-house</i>, not being a toll-house,
  <i>was laid in ashes; the first blood was shed</i> by
  &quot;Rebecca&#39;s company,&quot; as they call the rioters here. And
  <i>here</i> resides, rants, prays, and preaches, and scribbles
  sedition, an illiterate fanatic, who is recognised as an organ of one
  sect of Methodists, Whitfieldites publishing a monthly inflammatory
  Magazine, called Y Diwygiwr, (the
  &quot;<i>Reformer!</i>&quot;)&#8212;God bless the mark!</p>

  <p>This little pope, within his little circle of the &quot;great
  unwashed,&quot; is very oracular, and his infallibility a dogma with
  his followers and readers. How much he himself and his vulgar trash
  of prose run mad, stand in need of that wholesome reform which some
  of his English brother-firebrands have been taught in Coldbathfields
  and Newgate, let my reader judge from the following extract. The
  <i>Times</i> newspaper did good service in <i>gibbeting</i> this
  precious morceau, supplied by its indefatigable reporter, in its
  broad sheet. How great was the neglect of <i>Welsh</i> society, and
  every thing Welsh, when this sort of war-cry of treason could be
  raised, this trump of rebellion sounded, and, as it were, from the
  pulpit &quot;Evangelical,&quot; with perfect impunity to the
  demagogue, thus prostituting religion itself to the cause of
  anarchical crime!&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;We cannot regard these tumults, with their like in other
  parts, but as the effects of Tory oppression. Our wish is to see
  <i>Rebecca and her children arrayed by thousands, for the suppression
  of Toryism</i>. These are the only means to remove the burden from
  the back of the country.... Resolve to see the sword of reason
  plunged in oppression&#39;s heart.&quot; He goes on to say,
  &quot;<i>there must be a hard-blowing storm</i> before the high
  places in State and Church can be levelled,&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c.
  There is the usual twaddle about &quot;<i>moral</i> force,&quot;
  forsooth, under which saving periphrasis, now-a-days, every rebel
  ranter in field, or tub, or conventicle, insinuates lawless violence
  without naming it. Jack Cade would have made it the rallying cry of
  his raggamuffins, so would Wat Tyler, had it been hit upon in his
  day. The <i>array</i> of <i>thousands</i> is intelligible &quot;to
  the meanest capacity.&quot; The dullest Welsh &quot;copper-man,&quot;
  or collier, or wild farm cultivator, could not miss the meaning. But
  as to this magical weapon, &quot;moral force,&quot; which they are to
  handle when so arrayed&#8212;the brightest capacity must be at a loss
  to know what it means. How absurd (if he pretends such a thing) to
  expect that enlightened statesmen will stand reformed, restrained,
  stricken through, with a new light in politics by the exhibition of
  these smutty patriots&#39; <i>minds</i> alone!&#8212;by the force of
  conviction, wrought by ascertaining <i>their</i> convictions, (the
  <i>illuminati</i> of Llanelly coal-works, of Swansea copper-works, of
  Carmarthen farm-yards,) will instantly <i>tack</i>&#8212;put the
  vessel of State right about, and bring her triumphant into the placid
  haven of Radicalism! And why <i>physical</i> &quot;array&quot; to
  wield such shadowy arms as &quot;<i>moral</i>&quot; force? This
  favourite stalking-horse of incendiary politics is but the secret
  hiding-place of retreat from the &quot;force of government.&quot; The
  peace, the forbearance it breathes, is like the brief silence
  maintained&#8212;the holding of the breath&#8212;by those snugly
  ensconced within that other horse of famous memory, the
  <i>Trojan</i>, which served admirably to lay vigilance asleep, and
  evade the defensive <i>force</i> of the garrison, till the hour came
  to leap from its protection, and fire the citadel. This &quot;moral
  force&quot; covert of revolt, is every whit as hollow, as
  treacherous, as fatal, if trusted to. Inflame, enrage, and then
  gather together &quot;thousands&quot; of the most ignorant of
  mankind, pointing to a body, or a class, or a government, as the sole
  cause of whatever they suffer or dislike, and then&#8212;<i>tell</i>
  them to be moral! peaceable! not to use those tens of thousands of
  brawny arms, inured to the sledge-hammer; oh, no! tell them that
  <i>force</i> means to stand still&#8212;or disperse&#8212;or
  gabble&#8212;any thing but to&#8212;<i>fight!</i> And such vile
  &quot;juggling with us in a double sense&quot; as this, is
  evangelical morality!</p>

  <p>In justice to the Liberal party, I shall add that it does not
  sanction the ravings of this hypocrite, but laughs at his illiterate
  pretensions to the character of a public writer. As evidence of this,
  the editor of the <i>Welshman</i>, a Liberal journal, published at
  Carmarthen, has ably castigated this <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_773" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</a></span> sedition-monger, who has
  exposed his own ignorance in venting his wrath at the infliction.</p>

  <h4>Pontardulais. Monday Evening.</h4>

  <p>It was pleasant to emerge from that dingy seat of fanaticism and
  fury, pseudo religion and moral violation of religion&#39;s broad
  principles. Its aspect almost recalled the description of one of
  Rome&#39;s imperial monsters, equally in physionomy and
  nature&#8212;&quot;a mixture of dirt and blood.&quot; The day was
  superb, and the adjacent country, though rather tame <i>for
  Wales</i>, improved in rural beauty as we approached a crossway very
  near to this village, Pontardulais. Two cottages appeared in a green,
  quiet, dingle we were descending to, watered by a small river, and
  surrounded by sloping meadows, now yellowed by the evening sun, and
  well inhabited by their proper population, sheep and cows, now
  beginning their homeward course at the call of the milkmaid; the only
  other motion in this simply beautiful landscape, being a scattered
  gleaner or two, with her load, and the rather thick volume of blue
  smoke curling up from one of those cots, which, standing so close,
  without any other near, prompted the idea of some rustic old couple
  in conjugal quietude, smiling out life&#39;s evening, by themselves,
  apart from all the world. Such was the perfect calm of scene, and the
  day in which summer heat was joined to the golden serenity of
  autumn.</p>

  <p>We were beginning to dismiss ugly Rebeccaism from our thoughts,
  meditating where we should find one of those Isaac Waltonian
  hostelries, with a sign swinging from an old tree, which we delight
  to make our evening quarters; for Pontardulais, we knew, was too
  lately a little battle-field to afford hope of this tranquil bliss,
  for here had occurred the first conflict, in which men had been
  wounded and prisoners made. The advance of evening, with its halcyon
  attributes of all kinds, had the effect of a lullaby on the mind,
  disturbed at every stage by some hurrying dragoon, some eager
  gossiping group, or fresh &quot;news&quot; of some farm &quot;burned
  last night,&quot; or rumours of &quot;martial law&quot; being
  actually impending over us poor rebels of South Wales.</p>

  <p>Reaching the little houses in their lonely crossway, we were
  startled by the appearance of a gutted house; the walls alone having
  remained to present to us, on the higher ground, the semblance of a
  white cottage. The old thatch, fallen in, and timber, were still
  smouldering visibly, though the house was fired about one A.M.
  yesterday morning.</p>

  <p>Before the near adjoining cottage a quiet crowd of some twenty
  persons appeared, and a few rustic articles of furniture on the
  roadside. Where was their owner? Dismounting, we entered this
  cottage, that had looked all peaceful security so lately to our eyes.
  It had not been injured, but was all dismantled and in confusion; and
  stretched on some low sort of bench or seat, lay the murdered owner
  of that smoking ruin&#8212;the Hendy toll-house. Her coffin had been
  already made, (the coffin-plate giving her age, 75,) and stood
  leaning against the wall, but the body was preserved just as it fell,
  for the inspection of the jury. (The jury! a British jury! Is there a
  British <i>man</i>, incapable of perjury, of parricide, of bloody and
  blackest felony, <i>himself</i>, who will ever forget, who will ever
  cease to spurn, spit upon in thought, execrate in words, that
  degraded, wretched, most wicked knot of murder-screeners&#8212;<i>the
  Hendy Gate jury?</i>)</p>

  <p>There was nothing in this dismal spectacle for a poet to find
  there food for fancy. All was naked, ugly horror. An old rug just
  veiled the corpse, which, being turned down, revealed the orifice,
  just by the nipple, of a shot or slug wound, and her linen was stiff
  and saturated with the blood which had flowed. Another wound on the
  temple had caused a torrent of blood, which remained glued over the
  whole cheek. The retracted lips of this poor suffering creature, gave
  a dreadful grin to the aged countenance, expressing the strong agony
  she must have endured, no doubt from the filling up of the breast
  with those three pints of blood found there by the surgeons. The
  details of this savage murder have been too fully given in all the
  papers to need repetition here. Suffice it to say, that to any one
  <i>viewing</i> the body as we thus happened to do, the atrocity of
  this heartless treason against society and the injured dead becomes
  yet more striking; it seeming wonderful that the piteousness of the
  sight&#8212;the mute pleading <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span> of that mouth full of
  cloated blood&#8212;the arousing ocular evidence of the unprovoked
  assassin&#39;s cruelty&#8212;the helplessness of the aged
  woman&#8212;her innocence&#8212;all should not have kindled humanity
  in their hearts, (if all principle was dead in their dark minds,)
  just enough to dare to call a foul murder &quot;murder&quot;&#8212;to
  turn those twelve Rebecca-ridden, crouching slaves into <i>men</i>!
  Some of them, probably, had old helpless mothers at home; did no
  flying vision of her white hairs all blooded, and the breast, where
  they had lain and fed, full of blood also, cross the conscience of
  one of them, when, by their conspiracy, protection for life was to be
  denied to her, to all, by their unheard-of abuse of the only known
  British protective power&#8212;trial by jury? It is almost an apology
  for them to imagine, that one or more of them were actually part of
  the gang. Self-preservation, under <i>instant</i> danger, (involved
  in a just verdict,) is less revolting than the less urgent degree of
  the same natural impulse, implied in the hypothesis of pure selfish
  and most dastardly dread of some remoter evil to self from the
  ill-will of those impugned by a righteous verdict.</p>

  <p>The verdict, it will be remembered, was, that Sarah Williams died
  from effusion of blood, <i>but from what cause is to this jury
  unknown!!!</i> The designed <i>trick</i>&#8212;the sly juggle
  concocted by these men, sworn before Almighty God to tell truth
  respecting the cry of blood then rising to his throne, evidently was
  to leave a loop-hole for a doubt whereby justice might be
  defeated&#8212;a possibility, so they flattered themselves, that,
  just in the nick of time, a bloodvessel burst, or fright destroyed
  her, or any thing but the bloody hand of &quot;Rebecca.&quot; Though,
  as the slugs were actually found <i>in</i> the lungs, the hope they
  &quot;dressed themselves in&quot; was as &quot;drunk,&quot; as
  swinishly stupid, as their design was unmanly, inhuman, and
  devilish&#8212;to wink at this horror! to huddle up this murder, and
  hurry into the earth a murdered woman, as if she had lived out her
  term!</p>

  <p>Whatever was the prompting feeling of this monster-jury, let us
  hope that the arm of the law will reach them yet, for this double
  crime against bleeding innocence and against their country. It would
  be a fitting punishment to them, to pronounce every individual an
  outlaw&#8212;to deny him all benefit of those laws he has done his
  best to defeat, and leave the craven traitor to his kind&#8212;to
  adopt his beloved &quot;&#39;Becca&#39;s&quot; disguise for ever,
  skulk about the land that disowns him in petticoats, and blush out
  his life (if shame be left him;) and let his name be fixed up, as a
  scarecrow to deter such evil doers, on the wall of every court of
  justice:&#8212;&quot;To the infamous memory of A. B., one of the
  perjured protectors of murder&#8212;The Hendy Gate Jury!&quot;</p>

  <p>Most revolting was the <i>betrayed</i> bias of almost all we spoke
  with, toward palliation of this dark act. &quot;<i>Didn&#39;t she die
  in a fit; or of fright; or something?</i>&quot; was a frequent
  question, even from those near the scene of this tragedy.
  &quot;<i>What did ail the old creture to go near &#39;em? Name of
  goodness! didn&#39;t they order her not?</i>&quot; Even from her own
  sex, a disgusting lack of warm-hearted pity and indignation was most
  palpable. Truly, morality and the meeting-house have a deep gulf
  between them, if these are the morals of the people. The regular
  church is really so little prized here, that we can only turn to the
  <i>dissenting</i> ministers of religious instruction, for the lower
  orders. And seeing these doings and sentiments in the flocks, one
  turns with astonishment to those professing <i>teachers</i> of the
  Welsh, and is ready to exclaim&#8212;&quot;What is it that you
  <i>do</i> teach?&quot; Only the <i>mechanical</i> part of religion,
  only the necessary outer <i>mummery</i>, I shall venture to say,
  which, perhaps, all revealed religions require, to maintain a hold on
  the reverence of the common people. It seems impossible that the
  voice of <i>true</i> religion can have reached hearts that a slight
  pecuniary interest, the abatement of a turnpike toll, or the like,
  can sear against the death-shriek of murdered woman; the cry of blood
  out of the earth; the fear of God&#39;s judgement against perjury,
  and connivance at murder!</p>

  <h4>Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, Sept. 12.</h4>

  <p>Riding from Llanelly to this place, by a road skirting the coast,
  we, for the first time, heard the horn of Rebecca sounded, and
  replied to from among the darkling hills, the night being one of
  dusky moonlight. We <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_775" id=
  "Page_775">[Pg 775]</a></span> at first believed it the signal of
  some persons in the collieries, but learned that
  &quot;&#39;Becca&#39;s company&quot; had been out round Kidwelly that
  night, and an incendiary fire was the &quot;good work&quot;
  accomplished. It being near ten o&#39;clock at night, and our road
  wild and solitary, we felt rather pleased to gain the covert of this
  usually most quiet little town, with its air of antiquity and dead
  repose, as agreeable to a sentimental traveller, as unwelcome to its
  few traders and dwellers.</p>

  <p>The innkeepers and shopkeepers, <i>being much injured in their
  trades by</i> the terrifying effect of Rebeccaism on strangers, who
  have kept aloof all the summer, lift up the voice (but cautiously)
  against this terrible lady. Hardly an expression of regret for the
  poor victim at Hendy Gate reaches our ears; but rather, they seem to
  visit on her the anticipated severity of future dealing with the
  rioters, which they foresee.</p>

  <p>We see already posted placards, offering Â£500 for the discovery of
  the actual perpetrator of the murder of the poor toll-collector. It
  is headed &quot;Murder,&quot; in the teeth of the audacious, solemn
  declaration by the jury, of their ignorance of the cause of death.
  <i>Query</i>, Was a coroner warranted in receiving such a verdict?
  Was he not empowered&#8212;required&#8212;to send the jury back to
  learn common sense?</p>

  <h4>Inn between Carmarthen and Llandilo.</h4>

  <p>Just as we were sauntering in the rural road, admiring the
  placidity of the night, about ten o&#39;clock, and the twilight
  landscape of the banks of the Towey, a sudden light opened up to us
  the whole night prospect, where the farther side of this broad vale
  rises finely covered with woods, round Middleton Hall, and soon
  learned the nature of this sudden illumination and pyramidal fire,
  being the conflagration of extensive property belonging to its owner,
  Mr Adams, close to the mansion.</p>

  <p>The terror of the female inhabitants may be imagined, there being,
  I believe, not any male inmates but servants at home, and the
  incendiaries doing their work at that early hour in the most daring
  manner, firing guns, blowing horns, &amp;c. Mr Adams drove in just as
  the fire was at its height, (having, indeed, believed the house to be
  in flames while he approached,) and found the goods and moveables all
  brought out in fear of its catching fire; but it escaped&#8212;so did
  the Rebeccaites, of course.</p>

  <p>Not to extend too far these hasty Notes, I shall throw together
  the heads of a few made on the spot. Our &quot;sentimental
  journey&quot; occupied about three weeks, and brought us to almost
  every part infested by the disturbers. Having put up at an inn in the
  outskirts of a town in Cardiganshire for the night, leaving the
  horses, we walked to the town. As we returned, the night being rather
  dark, I was not conscious of any one being on the same road behind,
  and was talking to my son, rather earnestly, of the iniquitous
  verdict of the Hendy Gate assassin jury, when a voice behind asked in
  English, saucily, if <i>I</i> was going to attend the future trial of
  the &quot;Hugheses, and them of the Llanon village, then in Swansea
  jail?&quot; The tone clearly indicated how alien to the
  Welshman&#39;s feelings were those I was expressing, though but those
  of common humanity. Giving the voice in the dark such short answer,
  refusing to satisfy him, as the question deserved, and with
  responsive bluffness, we left the man behind, who, it proved, was
  bound to our inn. We found our parlour filled with farmers, who
  instantly became <i>mum</i> as we entered, but their eyes
  suspiciously surveyed us. It was near eleven o&#39;clock, so we
  retired to our double-bedded chamber, which happened to be situated
  over the parlour. The inn (whose owners were <i>ultra</i>
  &quot;Welshly,&quot; speaking English very badly,) was well situated
  for holding a midnight council of (Rebecca) war, being lonely, at the
  confluence of two roads, and this proved to be the nature of this
  late assemblage. We were just in bed, (having <i>secured the door as
  well as we could</i>,) when we heard through the imperfect flooring a
  very animated <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i> of Welsh tongues all astir at once, and I
  fancied I recognized the voice of the pious Christian in the dark,
  who had been moved by the spirit (of religion of course) to hint or
  betray his dissent from the Saxon &quot;stranger&#39;s&quot; rebuke
  of perjury and murder-screening. A few minutes after, several hurried
  out, and three or four discharges of guns followed in front of the
  house, but nothing more. I was pleased to think that the said house
  and windows were &quot;mine host&#39;s,&quot; and not mine, otherwise
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg
  776]</a></span> a little hail of shot might have followed the
  &quot;short thunder;&quot; but as it was, nothing more than this
  warning bravado (as I imagine it to have been) occurred.</p>

  <p>A great deal of <i>solo</i> spouting, by orators in orderly
  succession, went on till near two in the morning&#8212;<i>Sunday</i>.
  At least, falling asleep, I left this little patriot parliament
  sitting, and found it in full tongue on awaking at that hour. I
  suppose this sitting in judgment on toll-houses (and possibly
  <i>other</i> houses) of these anti-landlord committees, are
  <i>not</i> breaches of the observance of the Sabbath.</p>

  <p>On the whole, we may remark, that neither Poor-Law, nor Tory, nor
  Whig, nor right rule, nor misrule, nor politics, nor party, had the
  slightest influence in this astounding moral revolution among an
  agricultural people. Utterly false is almost all that the London
  Press broached and broaches, implicating ministers in the provocation
  of this outbreak. Twenty years of residence, and leisure for
  observation among them, allows me to positively deny that any feeling
  of discontent, any sense of oppression, any knowledge of
  &quot;Grievances,&quot; now so pompously heading columns of
  twaddle&#8212;ever existed before the <i>one</i> daily, weekly spur
  in their side, goaded this simple people to a foolish mode of
  resistance to it.</p>

  <p>Why, not one in ten of the farmers has yet heard of Sir Robert
  Peel&#39;s accession to office! and I doubt if one in twenty knows
  whether they live under a Whig or Tory administration. Nor does one
  in a hundred <i>care</i> which, or form one guess about their
  comparative merits.</p>

  <p>The only idea they have of Chartists, is a vague identification of
  them with &quot;<i>rebels</i>,&quot; as they <i>used</i> to call
  <i>all</i> sorts of rioters, not dreaming of their forming any party
  with definite views, unless that of seizing the good things of the
  earth, and postponing, <i>sine die</i>, the day of payment.</p>

  <p>Judge what chance the brawling apostles of Chartism would have
  here among them, especially under the difficulty of haranguing them
  through interpreters!</p>

  <p>The Poor-Law they certainly hate, but from no pity for paupers.
  The dislike arises from a wide spread belief, that the host of
  &quot;officers&quot; attached to it swallows up great part of what
  they pay for the poor. They grudged the poor-rate before, even when
  their own overseer paid it away to poor old lame Davy or blind
  Gwinny; but now that it reaches them by a more circuitous route, and
  in the altered form of loaves or workhouse support, they seem to lose
  sight of it, and fancy that it stops <i>by the way</i>, in the
  pockets of these &quot;strange&quot; new middlemen, as we may call
  them, thrust in between the farmers and their poor and worn-out
  labourers.</p>

  <p>The prevalence of the Welsh language perpetuates the ignorance
  which is at the root of the mischief. Of their <i>native</i> writers,
  I have given a specimen from the monthly magazine published at
  Llanelly, and the evil of these is uncorrected by English
  information.</p>

  <p>The work of mounting heavenward was, we are told, defeated by a
  confusion of tongues&#8212;the advance of civilization (which we may
  designate a progress toward a divine goal, that of soul-exalting and
  soul-saving wisdom) is as utterly prevented by this non-intercourse
  system between the civilized and the <i>half</i> civilized; which,
  with all deference to the ancient Britons, I must venture to consider
  them. Camden, the antiquary, has preserved a tradition, that
  &quot;certain Brittaines&quot; (Britons) going over into Armorica,
  and taking wives from among the people of Normandy, &quot;<i>did cut
  out their tongues</i>,&quot; through fear that, when they should
  become mothers, they might corrupt the Welsh tongue of the children,
  by teaching them that foreign language! The love of their own tongue
  thus appears to be of very old standing, if we are to believe this
  agreeable proof of it. I believe the extirpation of Welsh, as a
  spoken language, would pioneer the way to knowledge, civilization,
  and <i>religion</i> here, of which last blessing there is a grievous
  lack, judging from the morals of the people.</p>

  "ADVENTURES_IN_TEXAS"></a>ADVENTURES IN TEXAS.</h2>

  <h3>NO. II.</h3>

  <h3>A TRIAL BY JURY.</h3>

  <p>When I recovered from my state of insensibility, and once more
  opened my eyes, I was lying on the bank of a small but deep river. My
  horse was grazing quietly a few yards off, and beside me stood a man
  with folded arms, holding a wicker-covered flask in his hand. This
  was all I was able to observe; for my state of weakness prevented me
  from getting up and looking around me.</p>

  <p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; I gasped.</p>

  <p>&quot;Where are you, stranger? By the Jacinto; and that you are
  <i>by</i> it, and not <i>in</i> it, is no fault of your&#39;n, I
  reckon.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was something harsh and repulsive in the tone and manner in
  which these words were spoken, and in the grating scornful laugh that
  accompanied them, that jarred upon my nerves, and inspired me with a
  feeling of aversion towards the speaker. I knew that he was my
  deliverer; that he had saved my life, when my mustang, raging with
  thirst, had sprung head-foremost into the water; that, without him, I
  must inevitably have been drowned, even had the river been less deep
  than it was; and that it was by his care, and the whisky he had made
  me swallow, and of which I still felt the flavour on my tongue, that
  I had been recovered from the death-like swoon into which I had
  fallen. But had he done ten times as much for me, I could not have
  repressed the feeling of repugnance, the inexplicable dislike, with
  which the mere tones of his voice filled me. I turned my head away in
  order not to see him. There was a silence of some moments&#39;
  duration.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t seem as if my company was over and above
  agreeable,&quot; said the man at last.</p>

  <p>&quot;Your company not agreeable? This is the fourth day since I
  saw the face of a human being. During that time not a bit nor a drop
  has passed my tongue.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hallo! That&#39;s a lie,&quot; shouted the man with another
  strange wild laugh. &quot;You&#39;ve taken a mouthful out of my
  flask; not <i>taken</i> it, certainly, but it went over your tongue
  all the same. Where do you come from? The beast ain&#39;t
  your&#39;n.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr Neal&#39;s,&quot; answered I.</p>

  <p>&quot;See it is by the brand. But what brings you here from Mr
  Neal&#39;s? It&#39;s a good seventy mile to his plantation, right
  across the prairie. Ain&#39;t stole the horse, have you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Lost my way&#8212;four days&#8212;eaten nothing.&quot;</p>

  <p>These words were all I could articulate. I was too weak to
  talk.</p>

  <p>&quot;Four days without eatin&#39;,&quot; cried the man, with a
  laugh like the sharpening of a saw, &quot;and that in a Texas
  prairie, and with islands on all sides of you! Ha! I see how it is.
  You&#39;re a gentleman&#8212;that&#39;s plain enough. I was a sort of
  one myself once. You thought our Texas prairies was like the prairies
  in the States. Ha, ha! And so you didn&#39;t know how to help
  yourself. Did you see no bees in the air, no strawberries on the
  earth?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bees? Strawberries?&quot; repeated I.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, bees, which live in the hollow trees. Out of twenty
  trees there&#39;s sure to be one full of honey. So you saw no bees,
  eh? Perhaps you don&#39;t know the creturs when you see &#39;em.
  Ain&#39;t altogether so big as wild-geese or turkeys. But you must
  know what strawberries are, and that <i>they</i> don&#39;t grow upon
  the trees.&quot;</p>

  <p>All this was spoken in the same sneering savage manner as before,
  with the speaker&#39;s head half turned over his shoulder, while his
  features were distorted into a contemptuous grin.</p>

  <p>&quot;And if I had seen the bees, how was I to get at the honey
  without an axe?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How did you lose yourself?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My mustang&#8212;ran away&quot;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;I see. And you after him. You&#39;d have done better to let
  him run. But what d&#39;ye mean to do now?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am weak&#8212;sick to death. I wish to get to the nearest
  house&#8212;an inn&#8212;anywhere where men are.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Where men are,&quot; repeated the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</a></span>
  stranger, with his scornful smile. &quot;Where men are,&quot; he
  muttered again, taking a few steps on one side.</p>

  <p>I was hardly able to turn my head, but there was something strange
  in the man&#39;s movement that alarmed me; and, making a violent
  effort, I changed my position sufficiently to get him in sight again.
  He had drawn a long knife from his girdle, which he clutched in one
  hand, while he ran the fore finger of the other along its edge. I now
  for the first time got a full view of his face, and the impression it
  made upon me was any thing but favourable. His countenance was the
  wildest I had ever seen; his bloodshot eyes rolled like balls of fire
  in their sockets; while his movements and manner were indicative of a
  violent inward struggle. He did not stand still for three seconds
  together, but paced backwards and forwards with hurried irregular
  steps, casting wild glances over his shoulder, his fingers playing
  all the while with the knife, with the rapid and objectless movements
  of a maniac.</p>

  <p>I felt convinced that I was the cause of the struggle visibly
  going on within him, that my life or death was what he was deciding
  upon. But in the state I then was, death had no terror for me. The
  image of my mother, sisters, and father, passed before my eyes. I
  gave one thought to my peaceful happy home, and then looked upwards
  and prayed.</p>

  <p>The man had walked off to some distance. I turned myself a little
  more round, and, as I did so, I caught sight of the sane magnificent
  phenomenon which I had met with on the second day of my wanderings.
  The colossal live oak rose in all its silvery splendour, at the
  distance of a couple of miles. Whilst I was gazing at it, and
  reflecting on the strange ill luck that had made me pass within so
  short a distance of the river without finding it, I saw my new
  acquaintance approach a neighbouring cluster of trees, amongst which
  he disappeared.</p>

  <p>After a short time I again perceived him coming towards me with a
  slow and staggering step. As he drew near, I had an opportunity of
  examining his whole appearance. He was very tall and lean, but
  large-boned, and apparently of great strength. His face, which had
  not been shaved for several weeks, was so tanned by sun and weather,
  that he might have been taken for an Indian, had not the beard proved
  his claim to white blood. But his eyes were what most struck me.
  There was something so frightfully wild in their expression, a look
  of terror and desperation, like that of a man whom all the furies of
  hell were hunting and persecuting. His hair hung in long ragged locks
  over his forehead, cheeks, and neck, and round his head was bound a
  handkerchief, on which were several stains of a brownish black
  colour. Spots of the same kind were visible upon his leathern jacket,
  breeches, and mocassins; they were evidently blood stains. His
  hunting knife, which was nearly two feet long, with a rude wooden
  handle, was now replaced in his girdle, but in its stead he held a
  Kentucky rifle in his hand.</p>

  <p>Although I did my utmost to assume an indifferent countenance, my
  features doubtless expressed something of the repugnance and horror
  with which the man inspired me. He looked loweringly at me for a
  moment from under his shaggy eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&quot;You don&#39;t seem to like the company you&#39;ve got
  into,&quot; said he. &quot;Do I look so very desperate, then? Is it
  written so plainly on my face?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What should there be written upon your face?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What? What? Fools and children ask them questions.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will ask you none; but as a Christian, as my countryman, I
  beseech you&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Christian!&quot; interrupted he, with a hollow laugh.
  &quot;Countryman!&quot; He struck the but of his rifle hard upon the
  ground. &quot;That is my countryman&#8212;my only friend!&quot; he
  continued, as he examined the flint and lock of his weapon.
  &quot;That releases from all troubles; that&#39;s a true friend.
  Pooh! perhaps it&#39;ll release you too&#8212;put you to
  rest.&quot;</p>

  <p>These last words were uttered aside, and musingly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Put him to rest, as well as&#8212;&#8212; Pooh! One more or
  less&#8212;Perhaps it would drive away that cursed spectre.&quot;</p>

  <p>All this seemed to be spoken to his rifle.</p>

  <p>&quot;Will you swear not to betray me?&quot; cried he to me.
  &quot;Else, one touch&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he brought the gun to his shoulder, the muzzle
  pointed full at my breast.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[Pg
  779]</a></span></p>

  <p>I felt no fear. I am sure my pulse did not give a throb the more
  for this menace. So deadly weak and helpless as I lay, it was
  unnecessary to shoot me. The slightest blow from the but of the rifle
  would have driven the last faint spark of life out of my exhausted
  body. I looked calmly, indifferently even, into the muzzle of the
  piece.</p>

  <p>&quot;If you can answer it to your God, to your and my judge and
  creator, do your will.&quot;</p>

  <p>My words, which from faintness I could scarcely render audible,
  had, nevertheless, a sudden and startling effect upon the man. He
  trembled from head to foot, let the but of his gun fall heavily to
  the ground, and gazed at me with open mouth and staring eyes.</p>

  <p>&quot;This one, too, comes with his God!&quot; muttered he.
  &quot;God! and your and my creator&#8212;and&#8212;judge.&quot;</p>

  <p>He seemed hardly able to articulate these words, which were
  uttered by gasps and efforts, as though something had been choking
  him.</p>

  <p>&quot;His and my&#8212;judge&quot;&#8212;groaned he again.
  &quot;Can there be a God, a creator and judge?&quot;</p>

  <p>As he stood thus muttering to himself, his eyes suddenly became
  fixed, and his features horribly distorted.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do it not!&quot; cried he, in a shrill tone of horror, that
  rang through my head. &quot;It will bring no blessin&#39; with it. I
  am a dead man! God be merciful to me! My poor wife, my poor
  children!&quot;</p>

  <p>The rifle fell from his hands, and he smote his breast and
  forehead in a paroxysm of the wildest fury. It was frightful to
  behold the conscience-stricken wretch, stamping madly about, and
  casting glances of terror behind him, as though demons had been
  hunting him down. The foam flew from his mouth, and I expected each
  moment to see him fall to the ground in a fit of epilepsy. Gradually,
  however, he became more tranquil.</p>

  <p>&quot;D&#39;ye see nothin&#39; in my face?&quot; said he in a
  hoarse whisper, suddenly pausing close to where I lay.</p>

  <p>&quot;What should I see?&quot;</p>

  <p>He came yet nearer.</p>

  <p>&quot;Look well at me&#8212;<i>through</i> me, if you can.
  D&#39;ye see nothin&#39; now?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I see nothing,&quot; replied I.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! I understand, you can see nothin&#39;. Ain&#39;t in a
  spyin&#39; humour, I calkilate. No, no, that you ain&#39;t. After
  four days and nights fastin&#39;, one loses the fancy for many
  things. I&#39;ve tried it for two days myself. So, you are weak and
  faint, eh? But I needn&#39;t ask that, I reckon. You look bad enough.
  Take another drop of whisky; it&#39;ll strengthen you. But wait till
  I mix it.&quot;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stepped down to the edge of the river, and
  scooping up the water in the hollow of his hand, filled his flask
  with it. Then returning to me, he poured a little into my mouth.</p>

  <p>Even the bloodthirsty Indian appears less of a savage when engaged
  in a compassionate act, and the wild desperado I had fallen in with,
  seemed softened and humanized by the service he was rendering me. His
  voice sounded less harsh; his manner was calmer and milder.</p>

  <p>&quot;You wish to go to an inn?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, yes. These four days I have tasted
  nothing but a bit of tobacco.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Can you spare a bit of that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All I have.&quot;</p>

  <p>I handed him my cigar case, and the roll of <i>dulcissimus</i>. He
  snatched the latter from me, and bit into it with the furious
  eagerness of a wolf.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, the right sort this!&quot; muttered he to himself.
  &quot;Ah, young man, or old man&#8212;you&#39;re an old man,
  ain&#39;t you? How old are you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Two-and-twenty.&quot;</p>

  <p>He shook his head doubtingly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Can hardly believe that. But four days in the prairie, and
  nothin&#39; to eat. Well, it may be so. But, stranger, if I had had
  this bit of tobacco only ten days ago&#8212;A bit of tobacco is worth
  a deal sometimes. It might have saved a man&#39;s life!&quot;</p>

  <p>Again he groaned, and his accents became wild and unnatural.</p>

  <p>&quot;I say, stranger!&quot; cried he in a threatening tone.
  &quot;I say! D&#39;ye see yonder live oak? D&#39;ye see it? It&#39;s
  the Patriarch, and a finer and mightier one you won&#39;t find in the
  prairies, I reckon. D&#39;ye see it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do see it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! you see it,&quot; cried he fiercely. &quot;And what is
  it to you? What have you to do with the Patriarch, or with what lies
  under it? I reckon you had best not be too curious that way. If you
  dare take a step under that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_780"
  id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</a></span> tree.&quot;&#8212;He swore an oath
  too horrible to be repeated.</p>

  <p>&quot;There&#39;s a spectre there,&quot; cried he; &quot;a spectre
  that would fright you to death. Better keep away.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will keep away,&quot; replied I. &quot;I never thought of
  going near it. All I want is to get to the nearest plantation or
  inn.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! true, man&#8212;the next inn. I&#39;ll show you the way
  to it. I will.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You will save my life by so doing,&quot; said I, &quot;and I
  shall be ever grateful to you as my deliverer.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Deliverer!&quot; repeated he, with a wild laugh. &quot;Pooh!
  If you knew what sort of a deliverer&#8212;Pooh! What&#39;s the use
  of savin&#39; a life, when&#8212;yet I will&#8212;I will save yours,
  perhaps the cursed spectre will leave me then. Will you not? Will you
  not?&quot; cried he, suddenly changing his scornful mocking tones to
  those of entreaty and supplication, and turning his face in the
  direction of the live oak. Again his wildness of manner returned, and
  his eyes became fixed, as he gazed for some moments at the gigantic
  tree. Then darting away, he disappeared among the trees, whence he
  had fetched his rifle, and presently emerged again, leading a ready
  saddled horse with him. He called to me to mount mine, but seeing
  that I was unable even to rise from the ground, he stepped up to me,
  and with the greatest ease lifted me into the saddle with one hand,
  so light had I become during my long fast. Then taking the end of my
  lasso, he got upon his own horse and set off, leading my mustang
  after him.</p>

  <p>We rode on for some time without exchanging a word. My guide kept
  up a sort of muttered soliloquy; but as I was full ten paces in his
  rear, I could distinguish nothing of what he said. At times he would
  raise his rifle to his shoulder then lower it again, and speak to it,
  sometimes caressingly, sometimes in anger. More than once he turned
  his head, and cast keen searching glances at me, as though to see
  whether I were watching him or not.</p>

  <p>We had ridden more than an hour, and the strength which the whisky
  had given me was fast failing, so that I expected each moment to fall
  from my horse, when suddenly I caught sight of a kind of rude hedge,
  and almost immediately afterwards the wall of a small blockhouse
  became visible. A faint cry of joy escaped me, and I endeavoured, but
  in vain, to give my horse the spur. My guide turned round, fixed his
  wild eyes upon me, and spoke in a threatening tone.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are impatient, man! impatient, I see. You think now,
  perhaps&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am dying,&quot; was all I could utter. In fact, my senses
  were leaving me from exhaustion, and I really thought my last hour
  was come.</p>

  <p>&quot;Pooh! dyin&#39;! One don&#39;t die so easy. And
  yet&#8212;d&#8212;&#8212;n!&#8212;it might be true.&quot;</p>

  <p>He sprang off his horse, and was just in time to catch me in his
  arms as I fell from the saddle. A few drops of whisky, however,
  restored me to consciousness. My guide replaced me upon my mustang,
  and after passing through a potato ground, a field of Indian corn,
  and a small grove of peach-trees, we found ourselves at the door of
  the blockhouse.</p>

  <p>I was so utterly helpless, that my strange companion was obliged
  to lift me off my horse, and carry me into the dwelling. He sat me
  down upon a bench, passive and powerless as an infant. Strange to
  say, however, I was never better able to observe all that passed
  around me, than during the few hours of bodily debility that
  succeeded my immersion in the Jacinto. A blow with a reed would have
  knocked me off my seat, but my mental faculties, instead of
  participating in this weakness, seemed sharpened to an unusual degree
  of acuteness.</p>

  <p>The blockhouse in which we now were, was of the poorest possible
  description; a mere log hut, consisting of one room, that served as
  kitchen, sitting-room, and bedchamber. The door of rough planks swung
  heavily upon two hooks that fitted into iron rings, and formed a
  clumsy substitute for hinges; a wooden latch and heavy bar served to
  secure it; windows, properly speaking, there were none, but in their
  stead a few holes covered with dirty oiled paper; the floor was of
  clay, stamped hard and dry in the middle of the hut, but out of
  which, at the sides of the room, a crop of rank grass was growing, a
  foot or more high. In one corner stood a clumsy bedstead, in another
  a sort of table or counter, on which were half a dozen drinking
  glasses of various <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_781" id=
  "Page_781">[Pg 781]</a></span> sizes and patterns. The table
  consisted of four thick posts, firmly planted in the ground, and on
  which were nailed three boards that had apparently belonged to some
  chest or case, for they were partly painted, and there was a date,
  and the three first letters of a word upon one of them. A shelf fixed
  against the side of the hut supported an earthen pot or two, and
  three or four bottles, uncorked, and apparently empty; and from some
  wooden pegs wedged in between the logs, hung suspended a few articles
  of wearing apparel of no very cleanly aspect.</p>

  <p>Pacing up and down the hut with a kind of stealthy cat-like pace,
  was an individual, whose unprepossessing exterior was in good keeping
  with the wretched appearance of this Texian shebeen house. He was an
  undersized, stooping figure, red-haired, large mouthed, and possessed
  of small, reddish, pig&#39;s eyes, which he seemed totally unable to
  raise from the ground, and the lowering, hang-dog expression of
  which, corresponded fully with the treacherous, panther-like
  stealthiness of his step and movements. Without greeting us either by
  word or look, this personage dived into a dark corner of his
  tenement, brought out a full bottle, and placing it on the table
  beside the glasses, resumed the monotonous sort of exercise in which
  he had been indulging on our entrance.</p>

  <p>My guide and deliverer said nothing while the tavern-keeper was
  getting out the bottle, although he seemed to watch all his movements
  with a keen and suspicious eye. He now filled a large glass of
  spirits, and tossed it off at a single draught. When he had done
  this, he spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny!&quot;</p>

  <p>Johnny made no answer.</p>

  <p>&quot;This gentleman has eaten nothing for four days.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Johnny, without looking up, or
  intermitting his sneaking, restless walk from one corner of the room
  to the other.</p>

  <p>&quot;I said four days, d&#39;ye hear? Four days. Bring him tea
  immediately, strong tea, and then make some good beef soup. The tea
  must be ready directly, the soup in an hour at farthest, d&#39;ye
  understand? And then I want some whisky for myself, and a beefsteak
  and potatoes. Now, tell all that to your Sambo.&quot;</p>

  <p>Johnny did not seem to hear, but continued his walk, creeping
  along with noiseless step, and each time that he turned, giving a
  sort of spring like a cat or a panther.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ve money, Johnny,&quot; said my guide. &quot;Money,
  man, d&#39;ye hear?&quot; And so saying, he produced a tolerably full
  purse.</p>

  <p>For the first time Johnny raised his head, gave an indefinable
  sort of glance at the purse, and then springing forward, fixed his
  small, cunning eyes upon those of my guide, while a smile of strange
  meaning spread over his repulsive features.</p>

  <p>The two men stood for the space of a minute, staring at each
  other, without uttering a word. An infernal grin distended
  Johnny&#39;s coarse mouth from ear to ear. My guide seemed to gasp
  for breath.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ve money,&quot; cried he at last, striking the but of
  his rifle violently on the ground. &quot;D&#39;ye understand, Johnny?
  Money; and a rifle too, if needs be.&quot;</p>

  <p>He stepped to the table and filled another glass of raw spirits,
  which disappeared like the preceding one. While he drank, Johnny
  stole out of the room so softly that my companion was only made aware
  of his departure by the noise of the wooden latch. He then came up to
  me, took me in his arms without saying a word, and, carrying me to
  the bed, laid me gently down upon it.</p>

  <p>&quot;You make yourself at home,&quot; snarled Johnny, who just
  then came in again.</p>

  <p>&quot;Always do that, I reckon, when I&#39;m in a tavern,&quot;
  answered my guide, quietly pouring out and swallowing another
  glassful. &quot;The gentleman shall have your bed to-day. You and
  Sambo may sleep in the pigsty. You have none though, I
  believe?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob!&quot; screamed Johnny furiously.</p>

  <p>&quot;That&#39;s my name&#8212;Bob Rock.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;For the present,&quot; hissed Johnny, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>&quot;The same as yours is Johnny Down,&quot; replied Bob in the
  same tone. &quot;Pooh! Johnny, guess we know one another?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Rayther calkilate we do,&quot; replied Johnny through his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>&quot;And have done many a day,&quot; laughed Bob. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</a></span>
  &quot;You&#39;re the famous Bob from Sodoma in Georgia?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sodoma in Alabama, Johnny. Sodoma lies in Alabama,&quot;
  said Bob, filling another glass. &quot;Don&#39;t you know that yet,
  you who were above a year in Columbus, doin&#39; all sorts of dirty
  work?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Better hold your tongue, Bob,&quot; said Johnny, with a
  dangerous look at me.</p>

  <p>&quot;Pooh! Don&#39;t mind him, he won&#39;t talk, I&#39;ll answer
  for it. He&#39;s lost the taste for chatterin&#39; in the Jacinto
  prairie. But Sodoma,&quot; continued Bob, &quot;is in Alabama, man!
  Columbus in Georgia! They are parted by the Chatahoochie. Ah! that
  was a jolly life we led on the Chatahoochie. But nothin&#39; lasts in
  this world, as my old schoolmaster used to say. Pooh! They&#39;ve
  druv the Injuns a step further over the Mississippi now. But it was a
  glorious life&#8212;warn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

  <p>Again he filled his glass and drank.</p>

  <p>The information I gathered from this conversation as to the
  previous life and habits of these two men, had nothing in it very
  satisfactory or reassuring for me. In the whole of the south-western
  states there was no place that could boast of being the resort of so
  many outlaws and bad characters as the town of Sodoma. It is
  situated, or was situated, at least, a few years previously to the
  time I speak of, in Alabama, on Indian ground, and was the harbour of
  refuge for all the murderers and outcasts from the western and
  south-western parts of the Union. Here, under Indian government, they
  found shelter and security; and frightful were the crimes and
  cruelties perpetrated at this place. Scarcely a day passed without an
  assassination, not secretly committed but in broad sunlight. Bands of
  these wretches, armed with knives and rifles, used to cross the
  Chatahoochie, and make inroads into Columbus; break into houses, rob,
  murder, ill-treat women, and then return in triumph to their dens,
  laden with booty, and laughing at the laws. It was useless to think
  of pursuing them, or of obtaining justice, for they were on Indian
  territory; and many of the chiefs were in league with them. At length
  General Jackson and the government took it up. The Indians were
  driven over the Mississippi, the outlaws and murderers fled, Sodoma
  itself disappeared; and, released from its troublesome neighbours,
  Columbus is now as flourishing a state as any in the west.</p>

  <p>The recollections of their former life and exploits seemed highly
  interesting to the two comrades; and their communications became more
  and more confidential. Johnny filled himself a glass, and the
  conversation soon increased in animation. I could understand little
  of what they said, for they spoke a sort of thieves&#39; jargon.
  After a time, their voices sounded as a confused hum in my ears, the
  objects in the room became gradually less distinct, and I fell
  asleep.</p>

  <p>I was roused, not very gently, by a mulatto woman, who poured a
  spoonful of tea into my mouth before I had well opened my eyes. She
  at first did not appear to be attending to me with any great degree
  of good-will; but by the time she had given me half a dozen spoonsful
  her womanly sympathies began to be awakened, and her manner became
  kinder. The tea did me an infinite deal of good, and seemed to infuse
  new life into my veins. I finished the cup, and the mulatto laid me
  down again on my pillow with far more gentleness than she had lifted
  me up.</p>

  <p>&quot;Gor! Gor!&quot; cried she, &quot;what poor young man! Berry
  weak. Him soon better. One hour, massa, good soup.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Soup! What do you want with soup?&quot; grumbled Johnny.</p>

  <p>&quot;Him take soup. I cook it,&quot; screamed the woman.</p>

  <p>&quot;Worse for you if she don&#39;t, Johnny,&quot; said Bob.</p>

  <p>Johnny muttered something in reply, but I did not distinguish what
  it was, for my eyes closed, and I again fell asleep.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me as if I had not been five minutes slumbering when
  the mulatto returned with the soup. The tea had revived me, but this
  gave me strength; and when I had taken it I was able to sit up in my
  bed.</p>

  <p>While the woman was feeding me, Bob was eating his beefsteak. It
  was a piece of meat that might have sufficed for six persons, but the
  man seemed as hungry as if he had eaten nothing for three days. He
  cut off wedges half as big as his fist, swallowed them with ravenous
  eagerness, and, instead of bread, bit into some unpeeled potatoes.
  All this was washed down with glass after glass of raw <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</a></span>
  spirits, which had the effect of wakening him up, and infusing a
  certain degree of cheerfulness into his strange humour. He still
  spoke more to himself than to Johnny, but his recollections seemed
  agreeable; he nodded self-approvingly, and sometimes laughed aloud.
  At last he began to abuse Johnny for being, as he said, such a
  sneaking, cowardly fellow&#8212;such a treacherous, false-hearted
  gallows-bird.</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; said he, &quot;I am gallows-bird enough
  myself, but then I&#39;m open, and no man can say I&#39;m
  a-fear&#39;d; but Johnny, Johnny, who&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>I do not know what he was about to say, for Johnny sprang towards
  him, and placed both hands over his mouth, receiving in return a blow
  that knocked him as far as the door, through which he retreated,
  cursing and grumbling.</p>

  <p>I soon fell asleep again, and whilst in that state I had a
  confused sort of consciousness of various noises in the room, loud
  words, blows, and shouting. Wearied as I was, however, I believe no
  noise would have fully roused me, although hunger at last did.</p>

  <p>When I opened my eyes I saw the mulatto woman sitting by my bed,
  and keeping off the mosquitoes. She brought me the remainder of the
  soup, and promised, if I would sleep a couple of hours more, to bring
  me a beefsteak. Before the two hours had elapsed I awoke, hungrier
  than ever. After I had eaten all the beefsteak the woman would allow
  me, which was a very moderate quantity, she brought me a beer-glass
  full of the most delicious punch I ever tasted. I asked her where she
  had got the rum and lemons, and she told me that it was she who had
  bought them, as well as a stock of coffee and tea; that Johnny was
  her partner, but that he had done nothing but build the house, and
  badly built it was. She then began to abuse Johnny, and said he was a
  gambler; and, worse still, that he had had plenty of money once, but
  had lost it all; that she had first known him in Lower Natchez, but
  he had been obliged to run away from there in the night to save his
  neck. Bob was no better, she said; on the contrary&#8212;and here she
  made the gesture of cutting a man&#39;s throat&#8212;he was a very
  bad fellow, she added. He had got drunk after his dinner, knocked
  Johnny down, and broken every thing. He was now lying asleep outside
  the door; and Johnny had hidden himself somewhere.</p>

  <p>How long she continued speaking I know not, for I again fell into
  a deep sleep, which this time lasted six or seven hours.</p>

  <p>I was awakened by a strong grasp laid upon my arm, which made me
  cry out, more, however, from surprise than pain. Bob stood by my
  bedside; the traces of the preceding night&#39;s debauch plainly
  written on his haggard countenance. His bloodshot eyes were inflamed
  and swollen, and rolled with even more than their usual wildness; his
  mouth was open, and the jaws stiff and fixed; he looked as if he had
  just come from committing some frightful deed. I could fancy the
  first murderer to have worn such an aspect when gazing on the body of
  his slaughtered brother. I shrank back, horror-struck at his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>&quot;In God&#39;s name, man, what do you want?&quot;</p>

  <p>He made no answer.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are in a fever. You&#39;ve the ague!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, a fever,&quot; groaned he, shivering as he spoke;
  &quot;a fever, but not the one you mean; a fever, young man, such as
  God keep you from ever having.&quot;</p>

  <p>His whole frame shuddered while he uttered these words. There was
  a short pause.</p>

  <p>&quot;Curious that,&quot; continued he; &quot;I&#39;ve served more
  than one in the same way, but never thought of it
  afterwards&#8212;was forgotten in less than no time. Got to pay the
  whole score at once, I suppose. Can&#39;t rest a minute. In the open
  prairie it&#39;s the worst; there stands the old man, so plain, with
  his silver beard, and the spectre just behind him.&quot;</p>

  <p>His eyes rolled, he clenched his fists, and, striking his forehead
  furiously, rushed out of the hut.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes he returned, apparently more composed, and walked
  straight up to my bed.</p>

  <p>&quot;Stranger, you must do me a service,&quot; said he
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ten rather than one,&quot; replied I; &quot;any thing that
  is in my power. Do I not owe you my life?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;re a gentleman, I see, and a Christian. You must
  come with me to the squire&#8212;the Alcalde.&quot;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[Pg
  784]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;To the Alcalde, man! What must I go there for?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;ll see and hear when you get there; I&#39;ve
  something to tell him&#8212;something for his own ear.&quot;</p>

  <p>He drew a deep breath, and remained silent for a short time,
  gazing anxiously on all sides of him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Something,&quot; whispered he, &quot;that nobody else must
  hear.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But there&#39;s Johnny there. Why not take him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny!&quot; cried he, with a scornful laugh; &quot;Johnny!
  who&#39;s ten times worse than I am, bad as I be; and bad I am to be
  sure, but yet open and above board, always, till this time; but
  Johnny! he&#39;d sell his own mother. He&#39;s a cowardly,
  sneakin&#39;, treacherous hound, is Johnny.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was unnecessary to tell me this, for Johnny&#39;s character was
  written plainly enough upon his countenance.</p>

  <p>&quot;But why do you want me to go to the Alcalde?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why does one want people before the judge? He&#39;s a judge,
  man; a Mexican one certainly, but chosen by us Americans; and an
  American himself, as you and I are.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And how soon must I go?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Directly. I can&#39;t bear it any longer. It leaves me no
  peace. Not an hour&#39;s rest have I had for the last eight days.
  When I go out into the prairie, the spectre stands before me and
  beckons me on, and if I try to go another way, he comes behind me and
  drives me before him under the Patriarch. I see him just as plainly
  as when he was alive, only paler and sadder. It seems as if I could
  touch him with my hand. Even the bottle is no use now; neither rum,
  nor whisky, nor brandy, rid me of him; it don&#39;t, by the
  &#39;tarnel.&#8212;Curious that! I got drunk yesterday&#8212;thought
  to get rid of him; but he came in the night and drove me out. I was
  obliged to go. Wouldn&#39;t let me sleep; was forced to go under the
  Patriarch.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Under the Patriarch? the live oak?&quot; cried I, in
  astonishment.&#8212;&quot;Were you there in the night?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, that was I,&quot; replied he, in the same horribly
  confidential tone; &quot;and the spirit threatened me, and said I
  will leave you no peace, Bob, till you go to the Alcalde and tell
  him&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then I will go with you to the Alcalde, and that
  immediately,&quot; said I, raising myself up in bed. I could not help
  pitying the poor fellow from my very soul.</p>

  <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; croaked Johnny, who at this
  moment glided into the room. &quot;Not a step shall you stir till
  you&#39;ve paid.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny,&quot; said Bob, seizing his less powerful companion
  by the shoulders, lifting him up like a child, and then setting him
  down again with such force, that his knees cracked and bent under
  him;&#8212;&quot;Johnny, this gentlemen is my guest, d&#39;ye
  understand? And here is the reckonin&#39;, and mind yourself,
  Johnny&#8212;mind yourself, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

  <p>Johnny crept into a corner like a flogged hound; the mulatto
  woman, however, did not seem disposed to be so easily intimidated.
  Sticking her arms in her sides, she waddled boldly forward.</p>

  <p>&quot;You not take him &#39;way, Massa Bob?&quot;, screamed she.
  &quot;Him stop here. Him berry weak&#8212;not able for ride&#8212;not
  able for stand on him foot.&quot;</p>

  <p>This was true enough. Strong as I had felt in bed, I could hardly
  stand upright when I got out of it.</p>

  <p>For a moment Bob seemed undecided, but only for one moment; then,
  stepping up to the mulatto, he lifted her, fat and heavy as she was,
  in the same manner as he had done her partner, at least a foot from
  the ground, and carried her screaming and struggling to the door,
  which he kicked open. Then setting her down outside,
  &quot;Silence!&quot; roared he, &quot;and some good strong tea
  instead of your cursed chatter, and a fresh beefsteak instead of your
  stinking carcass. That will strengthen the gentleman; so be quick
  about it, you old brown-skinned beast, you!&quot;</p>

  <p>I had slept in my clothes, and my toilet was consequently soon
  made, by the help of a bowl of water and towel, which Bob made Johnny
  bring, and then ordered him to go and get our horses ready.</p>

  <p>A hearty breakfast of tea, butter, Indian corn bread, and steaks,
  increased my strength so much, that I was able to mount my mustang. I
  had still pains in all my limbs, but we rode slowly; the morning was
  bright, the air fresh and elastic, and I felt myself getting
  gradually better. Our path led through the prairie; the river
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[Pg
  785]</a></span> fringed with wood, on the one hand; the vast ocean of
  grass, sprinkled with innumerable islands of trees, on the other. We
  saw abundance of game, which sprang up under the very feet of our
  horses; but although Bob had his rifle, he made no use of it. He
  muttered continually to himself, and seemed to be arranging what he
  should say to the judge; for I heard him talking of things which I
  would just as soon not have listened to, if I could have helped it. I
  was heartily glad when we at length reached the plantation of the
  Alcalde.</p>

  <p>It seemed a very considerable one, and the size and appearance of
  the framework house bespoke comfort and every luxury. The building
  was surrounded by a group of China trees, which I should have thought
  about ten years of age, but which I afterwards learned had not been
  planted half that time, although they were already large enough to
  afford a very agreeable shade. Right in front of the house rose a
  live oak, inferior in size to the one in the prairie, but still of
  immense age and great beauty. To the left was some two hundred acres
  of cotton fields, extending to the bank of the Jacinto, which at this
  spot made a sharp turn, and winding round the plantation, enclosed it
  on three sides. Before the house lay the prairie, with its
  archipelago of islands, and herds of grazing cattle and mustangs; to
  the right, more cotton fields; and in rear of the dwelling, the negro
  cottages and out-buildings. There was a Sabbath-like stillness
  pervading the whole scene, which seemed to strike even Bob. He paused
  as though in deep thought, and allowed his hand to rest for a moment
  on the handle of the lattice door. Then with a sudden and resolute
  jerk, bespeaking an equally sudden resolution, he pushed open the
  gate, and we entered a garden planted with orange, banana, and citron
  trees, the path through which was enclosed between palisades, and led
  to a sort of front court, with another lattice-work door, beside
  which hung a bell. Upon ringing this, a negro appeared.</p>

  <p>The black seemed to know Bob very well, for he nodded to him as to
  an old acquaintance, and said the squire wanted him, and had asked
  after him several times. He then led the way to a large parlour, very
  handsomely furnished for Texas, and in which we found the squire, or
  more properly speaking, the Alcalde, sitting smoking his cigar. He
  had just breakfasted, and the plates and dishes were still upon the
  table. He did not appear to be much given to compliments or ceremony,
  or to partake at all of the Yankee failing of curiosity, for he
  answered our salutation with a laconic &quot;good-morning,&quot; and
  scarcely even looked at us. At the very first glance, it was easy to
  see that he came from Tennessee or Virginia, the only provinces in
  which one finds men of his gigantic mould. Even sitting, his head
  rose above those of the negro servants in waiting. Nor was his height
  alone remarkable; he had the true West-Virginian build; the enormous
  chest and shoulders, and herculean limbs, the massive features and
  sharp grey eyes; altogether an exterior well calculated to impose on
  the rough backwoodsmen with whom he had to deal.</p>

  <p>I was tired with my ride, and took a chair. The squire apparently
  did not deem me worthy of notice, or else he reserved me for a later
  scrutiny; but he fixed a long, searching look upon Bob, who remained
  standing, with his head sunk on his breast.</p>

  <p>The judge at last broke silence.</p>

  <p>&quot;So here you are again, Bob. It&#39;s long since we&#39;ve
  seen you, and I thought you had clean forgotten us. Well, Bob, we
  shouldn&#39;t have broke our hearts, I reckon; for I hate
  gamblers&#8212;ay, that I do&#8212;worse than skunks. It&#39;s a vile
  thing is play, and has ruined many a man in this world, and the next.
  It&#39;s ruined you too, Bob.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob said nothing.</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;d have been mighty useful here last week; there was
  plenty for you to do. My step-daughter arrived; but as you
  weren&#39;t to be found, we had to send to Joel to shoot us a buck
  and a couple of dozen snipes. Ah, Bob! one might still make a good
  citizen of you, if you&#39;d only leave off that cursed
  play!&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob still remained silent.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now go into the kitchen and get some breakfast.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob neither answered nor moved.</p>

  <p>&quot;D&#39;ye hear? Go into the kitchen and get something to eat.
  And, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[Pg
  786]</a></span> Ptoly&quot;&#8212;added he to the
  negro&#8212;&quot;tell Veny to give him a pint of rum.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t want yer rum&#8212;ain&#39;t
  thirsty&quot;&#8212;growled Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;Very like, very like,&quot; said the judge sharply.
  &quot;Reckon you&#39;ve taken too much already. Look as if you could
  swallow a wild cat, claws and all. And you,&quot; added he, turning
  to me&#8212;&quot;What the devil are you at, Ptoly? Don&#39;t you see
  the man wants his breakfast? Where&#39;s the coffee? Or would you
  rather have tea?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank you, Alcalde, I have breakfasted already.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t look as if. Ain&#39;t sick, are you? Where do you
  come from? What&#39;s happened to you? What are you doing with
  Bob?&quot;</p>

  <p>He looked keenly and searchingly at me, and then again at Bob. My
  appearance was certainly not very prepossessing, unshaven as I was,
  and with my clothes and linen soiled and torn. He was evidently
  considering what could be the motive of our visit, and what had
  brought me into Bob&#39;s society. The result of his physiognomical
  observations did not appear very favourable either to me or my
  companion. I hastened to explain.</p>

  <p>&quot;You shall hear how it was, judge. I am indebted to Bob for
  my life.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Your life! Indebted to Bob for your life!&quot; repeated the
  judge, shaking his head incredulously.</p>

  <p>I related how I had lost my way in the prairie; been carried into
  the Jacinto by my horse; and how I should inevitably have been
  drowned but for Bob&#39;s aid.</p>

  <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said the judge, when I had done speaking.
  &quot;So, Bob saved your life! Well, I am glad of it, Bob, very glad
  of it. Ah! if you could only keep away from that Johnny. I tell you,
  Bob, Johnny will be the ruin of you. Better keep out of his
  way.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s too late,&quot; answered Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t know why it should be. Never too late to leave a
  debauched, sinful life; never, man!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Calkilate it is, though,&quot; replied Bob sullenly.</p>

  <p>&quot;You calculate it is?&quot; said the judge, fixing his eyes
  on him. &quot;And why do you calculate that? Take a
  glass&#8212;Ptoly, a glass&#8212;and tell me, man, why should it be
  too late?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I ain&#39;t thirsty, squire,&quot; said Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t talk to me of your thirst; rum&#39;s not for
  thirst, but to strengthen the heart and nerves, to drive away the
  blue devils. And a good thing it is, taken in moderation.&quot;</p>

  <p>As he spoke he filled himself a glass, and drank half of it off.
  Bob shook his head.</p>

  <p>&quot;No rum for me, squire. I take no pleasure in it. I&#39;ve
  something on my mind too heavy for rum to wash away.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And what is that, Bob? Come, let&#39;s hear what you&#39;ve
  got to say. Or perhaps, you&#39;d rather speak to me alone. It&#39;s
  Sunday to-day, and no business ought to be done; but for once, and
  for you, we&#39;ll make an exception.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I brought the gentleman with me on purpose to witness what I
  had to say,&quot; answered Bob, taking a cigar out of a box that
  stood on the table, and lighting it. He smoked a whiff or two, looked
  thoughtfully at the judge, and then threw the cigar through the open
  window.</p>

  <p>&quot;It don&#39;t relish, squire; nothin&#39; does now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, Bob! if you&#39;d leave off play and drink! They&#39;re
  your ruin; worse than ague or fever.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s no use,&quot; continued Bob, as if he did not hear
  the judge&#39;s remark; &quot;it must out. I fo&#39;t agin it, and
  thought to drive it away, but it can&#39;t be done. I&#39;ve put a
  bit of lead into several before now, but this
  one&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; cried the judge, chucking his cigar
  away, and looking sternly at Bob. &quot;What&#39;s up now? What are
  you saying about a bit of lead? None of your Sodoma and Lower Natchez
  tricks, I hope? They won&#39;t do here. Don&#39;t understand such
  jokes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Pooh! they don&#39;t understand them a bit more in Natchez.
  If they did, I shouldn&#39;t be in Texas.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The less said of that the better, Bob. You promised to lead
  a new life here; so we won&#39;t rake up old stories.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I did, I did!&quot; groaned Bob; &quot;but it&#39;s all no
  use. I shall never be better till I&#39;m hung.&quot;</p>

  <p>I stared at the man in astonishment. The judge, however, took
  another cigar, lighted it, and, after puffing out a cloud of smoke,
  said, very unconcernedly&quot;&#8212;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[Pg
  787]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Not better till you&#39;re hung! What do you want to be hung
  for? To be sure, you should have been long ago, if the Georgia and
  Alabama papers don&#39;t lie. But we are not in the States here, but
  in Texas, under Mexican laws. It&#39;s nothing to us what you&#39;ve
  done yonder. Where there is no accuser there can be no
  judge.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Send away the nigger, squire,&quot; said Bob. &quot;What a
  free white man has to say, shouldn&#39;t be heard by black
  ears.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Go away, Ptoly,&quot; said the judge. &quot;Now, then,&quot;
  added he, turning to Bob, &quot;say what you have to say; but mind,
  nobody forces you to do it, and it&#39;s only out of good will that I
  listen to you, for to-day&#39;s Sunday.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I know that,&quot; muttered Bob; &quot;I know that, squire;
  but it leaves me no peace, and it must out. I&#39;ve been to San
  Felipe de Austin, to Anahuac, every where, but it&#39;s all no use.
  Wherever I go, the spectre follows me, and drives me back under the
  cursed Patriarch.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Under the Patriarch!&quot; exclaimed the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, under the Patriarch!&quot; groaned Bob. &quot;Don&#39;t
  you know the Patriarch; the old live oak near the ford, on the
  Jacinto?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I know, I know!&quot; answered the Judge. &quot;And what
  drives you under the Patriarch?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What drives me? What drives a man
  who&#8212;who&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;A man who&quot;&#8212;&#8212; repeated the judge,
  gently.</p>

  <p>&quot;A man,&quot; continued Bob, in the same low tone, &quot;who
  has sent a rifle bullet into another&#39;s heart. He lies there,
  under the Patriarch, whom I&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Whom you?&quot; asked the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Whom I killed!</i>&quot; said Bob, in a hollow
  whisper.</p>

  <p>&quot;Killed!&quot; exclaimed the judge. &quot;You killed him?
  Whom?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! whom? Why don&#39;t you let me speak? You always
  interrupt me with your palaver,&quot; growled Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are getting saucy, Bob,&quot; said the judge
  impatiently. &quot;Go on, however. I reckon it&#39;s only one of your
  usual tantrums.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob shook his head. The judge looked keenly at him for a moment,
  and then resumed in a sort of confidential, encouraging tone.</p>

  <p>&quot;Under the Patriarch; and how did he come under the
  Patriarch?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I dragged him there, and buried him there,&quot; replied
  Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;Dragged him there! Why did you drag him there?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Because he couldn&#39;t go himself, with more than half an
  ounce of lead in his body.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And <i>you</i> put the half ounce of lead into him, Bob?
  Well, if it was Johnny, you&#39;ve done the country a service, and
  saved it a rope.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob shook his head negatively.</p>

  <p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t Johnny, although&#8212;&#8212; But you shall
  hear all about it. It&#39;s just ten days since you paid me twenty
  dollars fifty.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I did so, Bob; twenty dollars fifty cents, and I advised you
  at the same time to let the money lie till you had a couple of
  hundred dollars, or enough to buy a quarter or an eighth of Sitio
  land; but advice is thrown away upon you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;When I got the money, I thought I&#39;d go down to San
  Felipe, to the Mexicans, and try my luck; and, at the same time, see
  the doctor about my fever. As I was goin&#39; there, I passed near
  Johnny&#39;s house, and fancied a glass, but determined not to get
  off my horse. I rode up to the window, and looked in. There was a man
  sittin&#39; at the table, havin&#39; a hearty good dinner of steaks
  and potatoes, and washin&#39; it down with a stiff glass of grog. I
  began to feel hungry myself, and while I was considerin&#39; whether
  I should &#39;light or not, Johnny came sneakin&#39; out, and
  whispered to me to come in, that there was a man inside with whom
  somethin&#39; might be done if we went the right way to work; a man
  who had a leather belt round his waist cram-full of hard Jackson; and
  that, if we got out the cards and pretended to play a little
  together, he would soon take the bait and join us.</p>

  <p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t much inclined to do it,&quot; continued Bob;
  &quot;but Johnny bothered me so to go in, that I got off my horse. As
  I did so the dollars chinked in my pocket, and the sound gave me a
  wish to play.</p>

  <p>&quot;I went in; and Johnny fetched the whisky bottle. One glass
  followed another. There were beefsteaks and potatoes too, but I only
  eat a couple of mouthfuls. When I had <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_788" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</a></span> drank two, three, ay,
  four glasses, Johnny brought the cards and dice. &#39;Hallo,
  Johnny!&#39; says I; &#39;cards and dice, Johnny! I&#39;ve twenty
  dollars fifty in my pocket. Let&#39;s have a game! But no more drink
  for me; for I know you, Johnny, I know you&#39;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny larfed slyly, and rattled the dice, and we sat down
  to play. I hadn&#39;t meant to drink any more, but play makes one
  thirsty; and with every glass I got more eager, and my dollars got
  fewer. I reckoned, however, that the stranger would join us, and that
  I should be able to win back from him; but not a bit of it: he sat
  quite quiet, and eat and drank as if he didn&#39;t see we were there.
  I went on playin&#39; madder than ever, and before half an hour was
  over, I was cleaned out; my twenty dollars fifty gone to the devil,
  or what&#39;s the same thing, into Johnny&#39;s pocket.</p>

  <p>&quot;When I found myself without a cent, I <i>was</i> mad, I
  reckon. It warn&#39;t the first time, nor the hundredth, that I had
  lost money. Many bigger sums than that&#8212;ay, hundreds and
  thousands of dollars had I played away&#8212;but they had none of
  them cost me the hundredth or thousandth part of the trouble to get
  that these twenty dollars fifty had; two full months had I been
  slavin&#39; away in the woods and prairies to airn them, and I caught
  the fever there. The fever I had still, but no money to cure it with.
  Johnny only larfed in my face, and rattled my dollars. I made a hit
  at him, which, if he hadn&#39;t jumped on one side, would have cured
  him of larfin&#39; for a week or two.</p>

  <p>&quot;Presently, however, he came sneakin&#39; up to me, and
  winkin&#39; and whisperin&#39;; and, &#39;Bob!&#39; says he, &#39;is
  it come to that with you? are you grown so chicken-hearted that you
  don&#39;t see the beltful of money round his body?&#39; said he,
  lookin&#39; at it. &#39;No end of hard coin, I guess; and all to be
  had for little more than half an ounce of lead.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did he say that?&quot; asked the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, that did he, but I wouldn&#39;t listen to him. I was mad
  with him for winning my twenty dollars; and I told him that, if he
  wanted the stranger&#39;s purse, he might take it himself, and be
  d&#8212;&#8212;d; that I wasn&#39;t goin&#39; to pull the hot
  chestnuts out of the fire for him. And I got on my horse, and rode
  away like mad.</p>

  <p>&quot;My head spun round like a mill. I couldn&#39;t get over my
  loss. I took the twenty dollars fifty more to heart than any money I
  had ever gambled. I didn&#39;t know where to go. I didn&#39;t dare go
  back to you, for I knew you&#39;d scold me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have scolded you, Bob; or, if I had, it
  would only have been for your good. I should have summoned Johnny
  before me, called together a jury of twelve of the neighbours, got
  you back your twenty dollars fifty, and sent Johnny out of the
  country; or, better still, out of the world.&quot;</p>

  <p>These words were spoken with much phlegm, but yet with a degree of
  feeling and sympathy, which greatly improved my opinion of the worthy
  judge. Bob also seemed touched. He drew a deep sigh, and gazed at the
  Alcalde with a melancholy look.</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s too late,&quot; muttered he; &quot;too late,
  squire.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; replied the judge, &quot;but let&#39;s
  hear the rest.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Bob, &quot;I kept riding on at random,
  and when evenin&#39; came I found myself near the palmetta field on
  the bank of the Jacinto. As I was ridin&#39; past it, I heard all at
  once the tramp of a horse. At that moment the queerest feelin&#39; I
  ever had came over me; a sort of cold shiverin&#39; feel. I forgot
  where I was; sight and hearin&#39; left me; I could only see two
  things, my twenty dollars fifty, and the well-filled belt of the
  stranger I had left at Johnny&#39;s. Just then a voice called to
  me.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Whence come, countryman, and whither going?&#39; it
  said.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Whence and whether,&#39; answered I, as surly as could
  be; &#39;to the devil at a gallop, and you&#39;d better ride on and
  tell him I&#39;m comin&#39;.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;You can do the errand yourself,&#39; answered the
  stranger larfin&#39;; &#39;my road don&#39;t lie that way.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;As he spoke, I looked round, and saw, what I was pretty sure
  of before, that it was the man with the belt full of money.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Ain&#39;t you the stranger I see&#39;d in the inn
  yonder?&#39; asked he.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;And if I am,&#39; says I; &#39;what&#39;s that to
  you?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Nothin&#39;,&#39; said he; &#39;nothin&#39;,
  certainly.&#39;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[Pg
  789]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Better ride on,&#39; says I; &#39;and leave me
  quiet.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Will so, stranger; but you needn&#39;t take it so
  mighty onkind. A word ain&#39;t a tomahawk, I reckon,&#39; said he.
  &#39;But I rayther expect your losin&#39;s at play ain&#39;t put you
  in a very church-goin&#39; humour; and, if I was you, I&#39;d keep my
  dollars in my pocket, and not set them on cards and dice.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;This put me in a rile to hear him cast my losin&#39;s in my
  teeth that way.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;You&#39;re a nice feller,&#39; said I, &#39;to throw a
  man&#39;s losses in his face. A pitiful chap <i>you</i> are,&#39;
  says I.</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought to provoke him, and that he&#39;d tackle me. But
  he seemed to have no fancy for a fight, for he said quite humble
  like&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;I throw nothin&#39; in your face; God forbid that I
  should reproach you with your losses! I&#39;m sorry for you, on the
  contrary. Don&#39;t look like a man who can afford to lose his
  dollars. Seem to me one who airns his money by hard work.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;We were just then halted at the further end of the cane
  brake, close to the trees that border the Jacinto. I had turned my
  horse, and was frontin&#39; the stranger. And all the time the devil
  was busy whisperin&#39; to me, and pointin&#39; to the belt round the
  man&#39;s waist. I could see where it was, plain enough, though he
  had buttoned his coat over it.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Hard work, indeed,&#39; says I; &#39;and now I&#39;ve
  lost every thing; not a cent left for a quid of baccy.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;If that&#39;s all,&#39; says he; &#39;there&#39;s help
  for that. I don&#39;t chew myself, and I ain&#39;t a rich man;
  I&#39;ve wife and children, and want every cent I&#39;ve got, but
  it&#39;s one&#39;s duty to help a countryman. You shall have money
  for tobacco and a dram.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;And so sayin&#39;, he took a purse out of his pocket, in
  which he carried his change. It was plenty full; there may have been
  some twenty dollars in it; and as he drew the string, it was as if
  the devil laughed and nodded to me out of the openin&#39; of the
  purse.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Halves!&#39; cried I.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;No, not that,&#39; says he; &#39;I&#39;ve wife and
  child, and what I have belongs to them; but half a
  dollar&#39;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Halves!&#39; cried I again; &#39;or
  else&#39;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Or else?&#39; repeated he: and, as he spoke, he put the
  purse back into his pocket, and laid hold of the rifle which was
  slung on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t force one to do you a mischief,&#39; said he.
  &#39;Don&#39;t&#39; says he; &#39;we might both be sorry for it. What
  you&#39;re thinkin&#39; of brings no blessin&#39;.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was past seein&#39; or hearin&#39;. A thousand devils from
  hell were possessin&#39; me.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Halves!&#39; I yelled out; and, as I said the word, he
  sprang out of the saddle, and fell back over his horse&#39;s crupper
  to the ground.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;I&#39;m a dead man!&#39; cried he; as well as the
  rattle in his throat would let him. &#39;God be merciful to me! My
  poor wife, my poor children!&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob paused; he gasped for breath, and the sweat stood in large
  drops upon his forehead. He gazed wildly round the room. The judge
  himself looked very pale. I tried to rise, but sank back in my chair.
  Without the table I believe I should have fallen to the ground.</p>

  <p>There was a gloomy pause of some moments&#39; duration. At last
  the judge broke silence.</p>

  <p>&quot;A hard, hard case!&quot; said he. &quot;Father, mother,
  children, all at one blow. Bob, you are a bad fellow; a very bad
  fellow; a great villain!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A great villain,&quot; groaned Bob. &quot;The ball was gone
  right through his breast.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps your gun went off by accident,&quot; said the judge
  anxiously. &quot;Perhaps it was his own ball.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob shook his head.</p>

  <p>&quot;I see him now, judge, as plain as can be, when he said,
  &#39;Don&#39;t force me to do you a mischief. We might both be sorry
  for it.&#39; But I pulled the trigger. His bullet is still in his
  rifle.</p>

  <p>&quot;When I saw him lie dead before me, I can&#39;t tell you what
  I felt. It warn&#39;t the first I had sent to his account; but yet I
  would have given all the purses and money in the world to have had
  him alive agin. I must have dragged him under the Patriarch, and dug
  a grave with my huntin&#39; knife; for I found him there
  afterwards.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You found him there?&quot; repeated the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. I don&#39;t know how he came there. I must have brought
  him, but I recollect nothin&#39; about it.&quot;</p>

  <p>The judge had risen from his chair, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_790" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</a></span> and was walking up and
  down the room, apparently in deep thought. Suddenly he stopped
  short.</p>

  <p>&quot;What have you done with his money?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I took his purse, but buried his belt with him, as well as a
  flask of rum, and some bread and beef he had brought away from
  Johnny&#39;s. I set out for San Felipe, and rode the whole day. In
  the evenin&#39;, when I looked about me, expectin&#39; to see the
  town, where do you think I was?&quot;</p>

  <p>The judge and I stared at him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Under the Patriarch. The ghost of the murdered man had
  driven me there. I had no peace till I&#39;d dug him up and buried
  him again. Next day I set off in another direction. I was out of
  tobacco, and I started across the prairie to Anahuac. Lord, what a
  day I passed! Wherever I went, <i>he</i> stood before me. If I
  turned, <i>he</i> turned too. Sometimes he came behind me, and looked
  over my shoulder. I spurred my mustang till the blood came,
  hopin&#39; to get away from him, but it was all no use. I thought
  when I got to Anahuac I should be quit of him, and I galloped on as
  if for life or death. But in the evenin&#39;, instead of bein&#39;
  close to the salt-works as I expected, there I was agin, under the
  Patriarch. I dug him up a second time, and sat and stared at him, and
  then buried him agin.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Queer that,&quot; observed the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, very queer!&quot; said Bob mournfully. &quot;But
  it&#39;s all no use. Nothin&#39; does me any good. I sha&#39;n&#39;t
  be better&#8212;I shall never have peace till I&#39;m hung.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob evidently felt relieved now, he had in a manner passed
  sentence on himself. Strange as it may appear, I had a similar
  feeling, and could not help nodding my head approvingly. The judge
  alone preserved an unmoved countenance.</p>

  <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said he, &quot;indeed! You think you&#39;ll be
  no better till you&#39;re hung.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Bob, with eager haste. &quot;Hung on the
  same tree under which <i>he</i> lies buried.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, if you will have it so, we&#39;ll see what can be done
  for you. We&#39;ll call a jury of the neighbours together
  to-morrow.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank ye, squire,&quot; murmured Bob, visibly comforted by
  this promise.</p>

  <p>&quot;We&#39;ll summon a jury,&quot; repeated the Alcalde,
  &quot;and see what can be done for you. You&#39;ll perhaps have
  changed your mind by that time.&quot;</p>

  <p>I stared at him like one fallen from the clouds, but he did not
  seem to notice my surprise.</p>

  <p>&quot;There is, perhaps, another way to get rid of your life, if
  you are tired of it,&quot; he continued. &quot;We might, perhaps, hit
  upon one that would satisfy your conscience.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob shook his head. I involuntarily made the same movement.</p>

  <p>&quot;At any rate, we&#39;ll hear what the neighbours say,&quot;
  added the judge.</p>

  <p>Bob stepped up to the judge, and held out his hand to bid him
  farewell. The other did not take it, and turning to me,
  said&#8212;&quot;<i>You</i> had better stop here, I think.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob turned round impetuously.</p>

  <p>&quot;The gentleman must come with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why must he?&quot; said the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ask himself.&quot;</p>

  <p>I again explained the obligations I was under to Bob; how we had
  fallen in with one another, and what care and attention he had shown
  me at Johnny&#39;s.</p>

  <p>The judge nodded approvingly.&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said he,
  &quot;you will remain here, and Bob will go alone. You are in a state
  of mind, Bob, in which a man is better alone, d&#39;ye see; and so
  leave the young man here. Another misfortune might happen; and, at
  any rate, he&#39;s better here than at Johnny&#39;s. Come back
  to-morrow, and we&#39;ll see what can be done for you.&quot;</p>

  <p>These words were spoken in a decided manner, which seemed to have
  its effect upon Bob. He nodded assentingly, and left the room. I
  remained staring at the judge, and lost in wonder at these strange
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>When Bob was gone, the Alcalde gave a blast on a shell, which
  supplied the place of a bell. Then seizing the cigar box, he tried
  one cigar after another, broke them peevishly up, and threw the
  pieces out of the window. The negro whom the shell had summoned,
  stood for some time waiting, while his master broke up the cigars,
  and threw them away. At <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_791" id=
  "Page_791">[Pg 791]</a></span> last the judge&#39;s patience seemed
  quite to leave him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hark ye, Ptoly!&quot; growled he to the frightened black,
  &quot;the next time you bring me cigars that neither draw nor smoke,
  I&#39;ll make your back smoke for it. Mind that,
  now;&#8212;there&#39;s not a single one of them worth a rotten maize
  stalk. Tell that old coffee-coloured hag of Johnny&#39;s, that
  I&#39;ll have no more of her cigars. Ride over to Mr Ducie&#39;s and
  fetch a box. And, d&#39;ye hear? Tell him I want to speak a word with
  him and the neighbours. Ask him to bring the neighbours with him
  to-morrow morning. And mind you&#39;re home again by two o&#39;clock.
  Take the mustang we caught last week. I want to see how he
  goes.&quot;</p>

  <p>The negro listened to these various commands with open mouth and
  staring eyes, then giving a perplexed look at his master, shot out of
  the room.</p>

  <p>&quot;Where away, Ptoly?&quot; shouted the Alcalde after him.</p>

  <p>&quot;To Massa Ducie.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Without a pass, Ptoly? And what are you going to say to Mr
  Ducie?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Him nebber send bad cigar again, him coffee-cullud hag.
  Massa speak to Johnny and neighbours. Johnny bring neighbours
  here.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought as much,&quot; said the judge with perfect
  equanimity. &quot;Wait a minute, I&#39;ll write the pass, and a
  couple of lines for Mr Ducie.&quot;</p>

  <p>This was soon done, and the negro dispatched on his errand. The
  judge waited till he heard the sound of his horse&#39;s feet
  galloping away, and then, laying hold of the box of despised cigars,
  lit the first which came to hand. It smoked capitally, as did also
  one that I took. They were Principes, and as good as I ever
  tasted.</p>

  <p>I passed the whole of that day <i>tÃªte Ã  tÃªte</i> with the judge,
  who, I soon found, knew various friends of mine in the States. I told
  him the circumstances under which I had come to Texas, and the
  intention I had of settling there, should I find the country to my
  liking. During our long conversation, I was able to form a very
  different, and much more favourable estimate of his character, than I
  had done from his interview with Bob. He was the very man to be
  useful to a new country; of great energy, sound judgment, enlarged
  and liberal views. He gave me some curious information as to the
  state of things in Texas; and did not think it necessary to conceal
  from me, as an American, and one who intended settling in the
  country, that there was a plan in agitation for throwing off the
  Mexican yoke, and declaring Texas an independent republic. The
  high-spirited, and, for the most part, intelligent emigrants from the
  United States, who formed a very large majority of the population of
  Texas, saw themselves, with no very patient feeling, under the rule
  of a people both morally and physically inferior to themselves. They
  looked with contempt, and justly so, on the bigoted, idle, and
  ignorant Mexicans, while the difference of religion, and interference
  of the priests, served to increase the dislike between the Spanish
  and Anglo-American races.</p>

  <p>Although the project was as yet not quite ripe for execution, it
  was discussed freely and openly by the American settlers. &quot;It is
  the interest of every man to keep it secret,&quot; said the judge;
  &quot;and there can be nothing to induce even the worst amongst us to
  betray a cause, by the success of which he is sure to profit. We have
  many bad characters in Texas, the offscourings of the United States,
  men like Bob, or far worse than him; but debauched, gambling, drunken
  villains though they be, they are the men we want when it comes to a
  struggle; and when that time arrives, they will all be found ready to
  put their shoulders to the wheel, use knife and rifle, and shed the
  last drop of their blood in defence of their fellow citizens, and of
  the new and independent republic of Texas. At this moment, we must
  wink at many things which would be severely punished in an older and
  more settled country; each man&#39;s arm is of immense value to the
  State; for, on the day of battle, we shall have, not two to one, but
  twenty to one opposed to us.&quot;</p>

  <p>I was awakened the following morning by the sound of a horse&#39;s
  feet; and, looking out of the window, saw Bob dismounting from his
  mustang. The last twenty-four hours had told fearfully upon him. His
  limbs seemed powerless, and he reeled <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_792" id="Page_792">[Pg 792]</a></span> nd staggered in such a
  manner, that I at first thought him intoxicated. But such was not the
  case. His was the deadly weariness caused by mental anguish. He
  looked like one just taken off the rack.</p>

  <p>Hastily pulling on my clothes, I hurried down stairs, and opened
  the house door. Bob stood with his head resting on his horse&#39;s
  neck, and his hands crossed, shivering, and groaning. When I spoke to
  him, he looked up, but did not seem to know me. I tied his horse to a
  post, and taking his hand, led him into the house. He followed like a
  child, apparently without the will or the power to resist; and when I
  placed him in a chair, he fell into it with a weight that made it
  crack under him, and shook the house. I could not get him to speak,
  and was about to return to my room to complete my toilet, when I
  again heard the tramp of mustangs. This was a party of half a dozen
  horsemen, all dressed in hunting shirts over buckskin breeches and
  jackets, and armed with rifles and bowie-knives; stout, daring
  looking fellows, evidently from the south-western states, with the
  true Kentucky half horse half alligator profile, and the usual
  allowance of thunder, lightning, and earthquake. It struck me when I
  saw them, that two or three thousand such men would have small
  difficulty in dealing with a whole army of Mexicans, if the latter
  were all of the pigmy, spindle-shanked breed I had seen on first
  landing. These giants could easily have walked away with a Mexican in
  each hand.</p>

  <p>They jumped off their horses, and threw the bridles to the negroes
  in the usual Kentuckian devil-may-care style, and then walked into
  the house with the air of people who make themselves at home every
  where, and who knew themselves to be more masters in Texas than the
  Mexicans themselves. On entering the parlour, they nodded a
  &quot;good-morning&quot; to me, rather coldly to be sure, for they
  had seen me talking with Bob, which probably did not much recommend
  me. Presently, four more horsemen rode up, and then a third party, so
  that there were now fourteen of them assembled, all decided-looking
  men, in the prime of life and strength. The judge, who slept in an
  adjoining room, had been awakened by the noise. I heard him jump out
  of bed, and not three minutes elapsed before he entered the
  parlour.</p>

  <p>After he had shaken hands with all his visitors, he presented me
  to them, and I found that I was in the presence of no less important
  persons than the Ayuntamiento of San Felipe de Austin; and that two
  of my worthy countrymen were corregidors, one a procurador, and the
  others <i>buenos hombres</i>, or freeholders. They did not seem,
  however, to prize their titles much, for they addressed one another
  by their surnames only.</p>

  <p>The negro brought a light, opened the cigar box, and arranged the
  chairs; the judge pointed to the sideboard, and to the cigars, and
  then sat down. Some took a dram, others lit a cigar.</p>

  <p>Several minutes elapsed, during which the men sat in perfect
  silence, as if they were collecting their thoughts, or, as though it
  were undignified to show any haste or impatience to speak. This grave
  sort of deliberation which is met with among certain classes, and in
  certain provinces of the Union, has often struck me as a curious
  feature of our national character. It partakes of the stoical dignity
  of the Indian at his council fire, and of the stern, religious
  gravity of the early puritan settlers in America.</p>

  <p>During this pause Bob was writhing on his chair like a worm, his
  face concealed by his hands, his elbows on his knees. At last, when
  all had drank and smoked, the judge laid down his cigar.</p>

  <p>&quot;Men!&quot; said he.</p>

  <p>&quot;Squire!&quot; answered they.</p>

  <p>&quot;We&#39;ve a business before us, which I calculate will be
  best explained by him whom it concerns.&quot;</p>

  <p>The men looked at the squire, then at Bob, then at me.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob Rock! or whatever your name may be, if you have aught to
  say, say it!&quot; continued the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Said it all yesterday,&quot; muttered Bob, his face still
  covered by his hands.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but you must say it again to-day. Yesterday was Sunday,
  and Sunday is a day of rest, and not of business. I will neither
  judge you, nor allow you to be judged, by what you said yesterday.
  Besides, it was all between ourselves, for I don&#39;t reckon Mr
  Rivers as any thing; I count him still as a stranger.&quot;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[Pg
  793]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the use of so much palaver, when the thing&#39;s
  plain enough?&quot; said Bob peevishly, raising his head as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>The men stared at him in grave astonishment. He was really
  frightful to behold, his face of a sort of blue tint; his cheeks
  hollow, his beard wild and ragged; his blood-shot eyes rolling, and
  deep sunk in their sockets. His appearance was scarcely human.</p>

  <p>&quot;I tell you, again,&quot; said the judge, &quot;I will
  condemn no man upon his own word alone; much less you, who have been
  in my service, and eaten of my bread. You accused yourself yesterday,
  but you were delirious at the time&#8212;you had the fever upon
  you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s no use, squire,&quot; said Bob, apparently touched
  by the kindness of the judge, &quot;You mean well, I see; butt though
  you might deliver me out of men&#39;s hands, you couldn&#39;t rescue
  me from myself. It&#39;s no use&#8212;I must be hung&#8212;hung on
  the same tree under which the man I killed lies buried.&quot;</p>

  <p>The men, or the jurors, as I may call them, looked at one another,
  but said nothing.</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s no use,&quot; again cried Bob, in a shrill,
  agonized tone. &quot;If he had attacked me, or only threatened me;
  but no, he didn&#39;t do it. I hear his words still, when he said,
  &#39;Do it not, man! I&#39;ve wife and child. What you intend, brings
  no blessin&#39; on the doer.&#39; But I heard nothin&#39; then except
  the voice of the devil; I brought the rifle
  down&#8212;levelled&#8212;fired.&quot;</p>

  <p>The man&#39;s agony was so intense, that even the iron featured
  jury seemed moved by it. They cast sharp, but stolen glances at Bob.
  There was a short silence.</p>

  <p>&quot;So you have killed a man?&quot; said a deep bass voice at
  last.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, that have I!&quot; gasped Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;And how came that?&quot; continued his questioner.</p>

  <p>&quot;How it came? You must ask the devil, or Johnny. No, not
  Johnny, he can tell you nothing; he was not there. No one can tell
  you but me; and I hardly know how it was. The man was at
  Johnny&#39;s, and Johnny showed me his belt full of money.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny!&quot; exclaimed several of the jury.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, Johnny! He reckoned on winning it from him, but the man
  was too cautious for that; and when Johnny had plucked all my
  feathers, won my twenty dollars fifty&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Twenty dollars fifty cents,&quot; interposed the judge,
  &quot;which I paid him for catching mustangs and shooting
  game.&quot;</p>

  <p>The men nodded.</p>

  <p>&quot;And then because he wouldn&#39;t play, you shot him?&quot;
  asked the same deep-toned voice as before.</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;some hours after&#8212;by the Jacinto, near the
  Patriarch&#8212;met him down there and killed him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thought there was something out o&#39; the common
  thereaway,&quot; said one of the jury; &quot;for as we rode by the
  tree a whole nation of kites and turkey buzzards flew out. Didn&#39;t
  they, Mr Heart?&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Heart nodded.</p>

  <p>&quot;Met him by the river, and cried, halves of his money,&quot;
  continued Bob mechanically. &quot;He said he&#39;d give me something
  to buy a quid, and more than enough for that, but not halves
  &#39;I&#39;ve wife and child,&#39; said he&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you?&quot; asked the juror with the deep voice, which
  this time, however, had a hollow sound in it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Shot him down,&quot; said Bob, with a wild hoarse laugh.</p>

  <p>For some time no word was spoken.</p>

  <p>&quot;And who was the man?&quot; said a juror at last.</p>

  <p>&quot;Didn&#39;t ask him; and it warn&#39;t written on his face.
  He was from the States; but whether a hosier, or a buckeye, or a
  mudhead, is more than I can say.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The thing must be investigated, Alcalde,&quot; said another
  of the jury after a second pause.</p>

  <p>&quot;It must so,&quot; answered the Alcalde.</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the good of so much investigation?&quot; grumbled
  Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;What good?&quot; repeated the Alcalde. &quot;Because we owe
  it to ourselves, to the dead man, and to you, not to sentence you
  without having held an inquest on the body. There&#39;s another thing
  which I must call your attention to,&quot; continued he, turning to
  the jury; &quot;the man is half out of his mind&#8212;not <i>compos
  mentis</i>, as they say. He&#39;s got the fever, and had it when he
  did the deed; he was urged on by Johnny, and maddened by his losses
  at play. In spite of his wild excitement, however, he saved that
  gentleman&#39;s life yonder, Mr Edward Nathanael Rivers.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did he so?&quot; said one of the jury.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[Pg
  794]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;That did he,&quot; replied I, &quot;not only by saving me
  from drowning when my horse dragged me, half dead and helpless, into
  the river, but also by the care and attention he forced Johnny and
  his mulatto to bestow upon me. Without him I should not be alive at
  this moment.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob gave me a look which went to my heart. The tears were standing
  in his eyes. The jury heard me in deep silence.</p>

  <p>&quot;It seems that Johnny led you on and excited you to
  this?&quot; said one of the jurors.</p>

  <p>&quot;I didn&#39;t say that. I only said that he pointed to the
  man&#39;s money bag, and said&#8212;&#8212; But what is it to you
  what Johnny said? I&#39;m the man who did it. I speak for myself, and
  I&#39;ll be hanged for myself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All very good, Bob,&quot; interposed the Alcalde; &quot;but
  we can&#39;t hang you without being sure you deserve it. What do you
  say to it, Mr Whyte? You&#39;re the procurador&#8212;and you, Mr
  Heart and Mr Stone? Help yourselves to rum or brandy; and, Mr Bright
  and Irwin, take another cigar. They&#39;re considerable tolerable the
  cigars&#8212;ain&#39;t they? That&#39;s brandy, Mr Whyte, in the
  diamond bottle.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Whyte had got up to give his opinion, as I thought, but I was
  mistaken. He stepped to the sideboard, took up a bottle in one hand
  and a glass in the other, every movement being performed with the
  greatest deliberation.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, squire,&quot; said he, &quot;or rather
  <i>Alcalde</i>&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>After the word <i>Alcalde</i>, he filled the glass half full of
  rum.</p>

  <p>&quot;If it&#39;s as we&#39;ve heard,&quot; added he, pouring
  about a spoonful of water on the rum, &quot;and Bob has killed the
  man&quot;&#8212;he continued, throwing in some lumps of
  sugar&#8212;&quot;murdered him&quot;&#8212;he went on, crushing the
  sugar with a wooden stamp&#8212;&quot;I rather
  calkilate&quot;&#8212;here he raised the glass&#8212;&quot;Bob ought
  to be hung,&quot; he concluded, putting the tumbler to his mouth and
  emptying it.</p>

  <p>The jurors nodded in silence. Bob drew a deep breath, as if a load
  were taken off his breast.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the judge, who did not look over well
  pleased; &quot;if you all think so, and Bob is agreed, I calculate we
  must do as he wishes. I tell you, though, I don&#39;t do it
  willingly. At any rate we must find the dead man first, and examine
  Johnny. We owe that to ourselves and to Bob.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said the jury with one voice.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a dreadful murderer, Bob a very considerable
  one,&quot; continued the judge; &quot;but I tell you to your face,
  and not to flatter you, there is more good in your little finger than
  in Johnny&#39;s whole hide. And I&#39;m sorry for you, because, at
  the bottom, you are not a bad man, though you&#39;ve been led away by
  bad company and example. I calculate you might still be reformed, and
  made very useful&#8212;more so, perhaps, than you think. Your
  rifle&#39;s a capital good one.&quot;</p>

  <p>At these last words the men all looked up, and threw a keen
  enquiring glance at Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;You might be of great service,&quot; continued the judge
  encouragingly, &quot;to the country and to your fellow-citizens.
  You&#39;re worth a dozen Mexicans any day.&quot;</p>

  <p>While the judge was speaking, Bob let his head fall on his breast,
  and seemed reflecting. He now looked up.</p>

  <p>&quot;I understand, squire; I see what you&#39;re drivin&#39; at.
  But I can&#39;t do it&#8212;I can&#39;t wait so long. My life&#39;s a
  burthen and a sufferin&#39; to me. Wherever I go, by day or by night,
  he&#39;s always there, standin&#39; before me, and drivin&#39; me
  under the Patriarch.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was a pause of some duration. The Judge resumed.</p>

  <p>&quot;So be it, then,&quot; said he with a sort of suppressed
  sigh. &quot;We&#39;ll see the body to-day, Bob, and you may come
  to-morrow at ten o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Couldn&#39;t it be sooner?&quot; asked Bob impatiently.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why sooner? Are you in such a hurry?&quot; asked Mr
  Heart.</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s the use of palaverin&#39;?&quot; said Bob
  sulkily. &quot;I told you already I&#39;m sick of my life. If you
  don&#39;t come till ten o&#39;clock, by the time you&#39;ve had your
  talk out and ridden to the Patriarch, the fever&#39;ll be upon
  me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But we can&#39;t be flying about like a parcel of wild
  geese, because of your fever,&quot; said the procurador.</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Bob humbly.</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s an ugly customer the fever, though, Mr Whyte,&quot;
  observed Mr Trace; &quot;and I calculate we ought to do him that
  pleasure. What do you think, squire?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I reckon he&#39;s rather indiscreet in his
  askin&#39;s,&quot; said the judge, in a tone of <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</a></span>
  vexation. &quot;However, as he wishes it, and if it is agreeable to
  you,&quot; added he, turning to the Ayuntamiento; &quot;and as
  it&#39;s you, Bob, I calculate we must do what you ask.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thankee,&quot; said Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;Nothing to thank for,&quot; growled the judge. &quot;And now
  go into the kitchen and get a good meal of roast beef, d&#39;ye
  hear?&quot; He knocked upon the table. &quot;Some good roast beef for
  Bob,&quot; said he to a negress who entered; &quot;and see that he
  eats it. And get your self dressed more decently, Bob&#8212;like a
  white man and a Christian, not like a wild redskin.&quot;</p>

  <p>The negress and Bob left the room. The conversation now turned
  upon Johnny, who appeared, from all accounts, to be a very bad and
  dangerous fellow; and after a short discussion, they agreed to lynch
  him, in backwoodsman&#39;s phrase, just as cooly as if they had been
  talking of catching a mustang. When the men had come to this
  satisfactory conclusion, they got up, drank the judge&#39;s health
  and mine, shook us by the hand, and left the house.</p>

  <p>The day passed more heavily than the preceding one. I was too much
  engrossed with the strange scene I had witnessed to talk much. The
  judge, too, was in a very bad humour. He was vexed that a man should
  be hung who might render the country much and good service if he
  remained alive. That Johnny, the miserable, cowardly, treacherous
  Johnny, should be sent out of the world as quickly as possible, was
  perfectly correct, but with Bob it was very different. In vain did I
  remind him of the crime of which Bob had been guilty&#8212;of the
  outraged laws of God and man&#8212;and of the atonement due. It was
  of no use. If Bob had sinned against society, he could repair his
  fault much better by remaining alive than by being hung; and, for
  anything else, God would avenge it in his own good time. We parted
  for the night, neither of us convinced by the other&#39;s
  arguments.</p>

  <p>We were sitting at breakfast the next morning, when a man, dressed
  in black, rode up to the door. It was Bob, but so metamorphosed that
  I scarcely knew him. Instead of the torn and bloodstained
  handkerchief round his head, he wore a hat; instead of the leathern
  jacket, a decent cloth coat. He had shaved off his beard too, and
  looked quite another man. His manner had altered with his dress; he
  seemed tranquil and resigned. With a mild and submissive look, he
  held out his hand to the judge, who took it and shook it
  heartily.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, Bob!&quot; said he, &quot;if you had only listened to
  what I so often told you! I had those clothes brought on purpose from
  New Orleans, in order that, on Sundays at least, you might look like
  a decent and respectable man. How often have I asked you to put them
  on, and come with us to meeting, to hear Mr Bliss preach? There is
  same truth in the saying, the coat makes the man. With his Sunday
  coat, a man often puts on other and better thoughts. If that had been
  your case only fifty-two times in the year, you&#39;d have learned to
  avoid Johnny before now.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob said nothing.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, well! I&#39;ve done all I could to make a better men
  of you. All that was in my power.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That you have,&quot; answered Bob, much moved. &quot;God
  reward you for it!&quot;</p>

  <p>I could not help holding out my hand to the worthy judge; and as I
  did so I thought I saw a moistness in his eye, which he suppressed,
  however, and, turning to his breakfast table, bade us sit down. Bob
  thanked him humbly, but declined, saying that he wished to appear
  fasting before his offended Creator. The judge insisted, and reasoned
  with him, and at last he took a chair.</p>

  <p>Before we had done breakfast our friends of the preceding day
  began to drop in, and some of them joined at the meal. When they had
  all taken what they chose, the judge ordered the negroes to clear
  away, and leave the room. This done, he seated himself at the upper
  end of the table, with the Ayuntamiento on either side, and Bob
  facing him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr Whyte,&quot; said the Alcade, &quot;have you, as
  procurador, any thing to state?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, Alcalde,&quot; replied the procurador. &quot;In virtue
  of my office, I made a search in the place mentioned by Bob Rock, and
  there found the body of a man who had met his death by a gunshot
  wound. I also found a belt full of money, and several letters of
  recommendation to different planters, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_796" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</a></span> from which it appears
  that the man was on his way from Illinois to San Felipe, in order to
  buy land of Colonel Austin, and to settle in Texas.&quot;</p>

  <p>The procurador then produced a pair of saddle-bags, out of which
  he took a leathern belt stuffed with money, which he laid on the
  table, together with the letters. The judge opened the belt, and
  counted the money. It amounted to upwards of five hundred dollars, in
  gold and silver. The procurador then read the letters.</p>

  <p>One of the corregidors now announced that Johnny and his mulatto
  had left their house and fled. He, the corregidor, had sent people in
  pursuit of them; but as yet there were no tidings of their capture.
  This piece of intelligence seemed to vex the judge greatly, but he
  made no remark on it at the time.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob Rock!&quot; cried he.</p>

  <p>Bob stepped forward.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob Rock, or by whatever other name you may be known, are
  you guilty or not guilty of this man&#39;s death?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Guilty!&quot; replied Bob, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>&quot;Gentlemen of the jury, will you be pleased to give your
  verdict?&quot;</p>

  <p>The jury left the room. In ten minutes they returned.</p>

  <p>&quot;Guilty!&quot; said the foreman.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob Rock,&quot; said the judge solemnly, &quot;your
  fellow-citizens have found you guilty; and I pronounce the
  sentence&#8212;that you be hung by the neck until you are dead. The
  Lord be merciful to your soul!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Amen!&quot; said all present.</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank ye,&quot; murmured Bob.</p>

  <p>&quot;We will seal up the property of the deceased,&quot; said the
  judge, &quot;and then proceed to our painful duty.&quot;</p>

  <p>He called for a light, and he and the procurador and corregidors
  sealed up the papers and money.</p>

  <p>&quot;Has any one aught to allege why the sentence should not be
  put in execution?&quot; said the Alcalde, with a glance at me.</p>

  <p>&quot;He saved my life, judge and fellow-citizens,&quot; cried I,
  deeply moved.</p>

  <p>Bob shook his head mournfully.</p>

  <p>&quot;Let us go, then, in God&#39;s name,&quot; said the
  judge.</p>

  <p>Without another word being spoken, we left the house and mounted
  our horses. The judge had brought a Bible with him; and he rode on, a
  little in front, with Bob, doing his best to prepare him for the
  eternity to which he was hastening. Bob listened attentively for some
  time; but at last he seemed to get impatient and pushed his mustang
  into so fast a trot, that for a moment we suspected him of wishing to
  escape the doom he had so eagerly sought. But it was only that he
  feared the fever might return before the expiration of the short time
  he yet had to live.</p>

  <p>After an hour&#39;s ride, we came to the enormous live oak
  distinguished as <i>the Patriarch</i>. Two or three of the men
  dismounted, and held aside the heavy moss-covered branches which
  swept the ground, and formed a complete curtain round the tree. The
  party rode through the opening thus made, and drew up in a circle
  beneath the huge leafy dome. In the centre of this ring stood Bob,
  trembling like an aspen-leaf, and with his eyes fixed on a small
  mound of fresh earth, partly concealed by the branches, and which had
  escaped my notice on my former visit to the tree. It was the grave of
  the murdered man.</p>

  <p>A magnificent burial-place was that: no poet could have dreamt or
  desired a better. Above, the huge vault, with its natural frettings
  and arches; below, the greenest, freshest grass; around, an eternal
  half light, streaked and varied, and radiant as a rainbow. It was
  imposingly beautiful.</p>

  <p>Bob, the judge, and the corregidors, remained sitting on their
  horses, but several of the other men dismounted. One of the latter
  cut the lasso from Bob&#39;s saddle, and threw an end of it over one
  of the lowermost branches; then uniting the two ends, formed them
  into a strong noose, which he left dangling from the bough. This
  simple preparation completed, the Alcalde took off his hat and folded
  his hands. The others followed his example.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob!&quot; said the judge to the unfortunate criminal, whose
  head was bowed on his horse&#39;s mane; &quot;Bob! we will pray for
  your poor soul, which is about to part from your sinful
  body.&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob raised his head. &quot;I had something to say,&quot; exclaimed
  he, in a wondering and husky tone. &quot;Something I wanted to
  say.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What have you to say?&quot;</p>

  <p>Bob stared around him; his lips <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_797" id="Page_797">[Pg 797]</a></span> moved, but no word
  escaped him. His spirit was evidently no longer with things of this
  earth.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob!&quot; said the judge again, &quot;we will pray for your
  soul.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Pray! pray!&quot; groaned he. &quot;I shall need
  it.&quot;</p>

  <p>In slow and solemn accents, and with great feeling, the judge
  uttered the Lord&#39;s Prayer. Bob repeated every word after him.
  When it was ended&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;God be merciful to your soul!&quot; exclaimed the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;Amen!&quot; said all present.</p>

  <p>One of the corregidors now passed the noose of the lasso round
  Bob&#39;s neck, another bound his eyes, a third person drew his feet
  out of the stirrups, while a fourth stepped behind his horse with a
  heavy riding-whip. All was done in the deepest silence; not a word
  was breathed; not a footfall heard on the soft yielding turf. There
  was something awful and oppressive in the profound stillness that
  reigned in the vast enclosure.</p>

  <p>The whip fell. The horse gave a spring forwards. At the same
  moment Bob made a desperate clutch at the bridle, and a loud
  &quot;Hold!&quot; burst in thrilling tones from the lips of the
  judge.</p>

  <p>It was too late, Bob was already hanging. The judge pushed
  forward, nearly riding down the man who held the whip, and seizing
  Bob in his arms, raised him on his own horse, supporting him with one
  hand, while with the other he strove to unfasten the noose. His whole
  gigantic frame trembled with eagerness and exertion. The procurador,
  corregidors, all, in short, stood in open-mouthed wonder at this
  strange proceeding.</p>

  <p>&quot;Whisky! whisky! has nobody any whisky?&quot; shouted the
  judge.</p>

  <p>One of the men sprang forward with a whisky-flask, another
  supported the body, and a third the feet, of the half-hanged man,
  while the judge poured a few drops of spirits into his mouth. The
  cravat, which had not been taken off, had hindered the breaking of
  the neck. Bob at last opened his eyes, and gazed vacantly around
  him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob,&quot; said the judge, &quot;you had something to say,
  hadn&#39;t you, about Johnny?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Johnny,&quot; gasped Bob; &quot;Johnny.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s become of him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He&#39;s gone to San Antonio, Johnny.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To San Antonio!&quot; repeated the judge, with an expression
  of great alarm overspreading his features.</p>

  <p>&quot;To San Antonio&#8212;to Padre JosÃ©,&quot; continued Bob;
  &quot;a Catholic. Beware!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A traitor, then!&quot; muttered several.</p>

  <p>&quot;Catholic!&quot; exclaimed the judge. The words he had heard
  seemed to deprive him of all strength. His arms fell slowly and
  gradually by his side, and Bob was again hanging from the lasso.</p>

  <p>&quot;A Catholic! a traitor!&quot; repeated several of the men;
  &quot;a citizen and a traitor!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So it is, men!&quot; exclaimed the judge. &quot;We&#39;ve no
  time to lose,&quot; continued he, in a harsh, hurried voice; &quot;no
  time to lose; we must catch him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That must we,&quot; said several voices, &quot;or our plans
  are betrayed to the Mexicans.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;After him immediately to San Antonio!&quot; cried the judge
  with the same desperately hurried manner.</p>

  <p>&quot;To San Antonio!&quot; repeated the men, pushing their way
  through the curtain of moss and branches. As soon as they were
  outside, those who were dismounted sprang into the saddle, and,
  without another word, the whole party galloped away in the direction
  of San Antonio.</p>

  <p>The judge alone remained, seemingly lost in thought; his
  countenance pale and anxious, and his eyes following the riders. His
  reverie, however, had lasted but a very few seconds, when he seized
  my arm.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hasten to my house,&quot; cried he; &quot;lose no time,
  don&#39;t spare horse-flesh. Take Ptoly and a fresh beast; hurry over
  to San Felipe, and tell Stephen Austin what has happened, and what
  you have seen and heard.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But, judge&quot;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Off with you at once, if you would do Texas a service. Bring
  my wife and daughter back.&quot;</p>

  <p>And so saying, he literally drove me from under the tree, pushing
  me out with hands and feet. I was so startled at the expression of
  violent impatience and anxiety which his features assumed, that,
  without venturing to make further objection, I struck the spurs into
  my mustang and galloped off.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[Pg
  798]</a></span></p>

  <p>Before I had got fifty yards from the tree, I looked round. The
  judge had disappeared.</p>

  <p>I rode full speed to the judge&#39;s house, and thence on a fresh
  horse to San Felipe, where I found Colonel Austin, who seemed much
  alarmed by the news I brought him, had horses saddled, and sent round
  to all the neighbours. Before the wife and step-daughter of the judge
  had made their preparations to accompany me home, he started with
  fifty armed men in the direction of San Antonio.</p>

  <p>I escorted the ladies to their house, but scarcely had we arrived
  there, when I was seized with a fever, the result of my recent
  fatigues and sufferings. For some days my life was in danger, but at
  last a good constitution, and the kindest and most watchful nursing,
  triumphed over the disease. As soon as I was able to mount a horse, I
  set out for Mr Neal&#39;s plantation, in company with his huntsman
  Anthony, who, after spending many days, and riding over hundreds of
  miles of ground in quest of me, had at last found me out.</p>

  <p>Our way led up past the Patriarch, and, as we approached it, we
  saw innumerable birds of prey, and carrion crows circling round it,
  croaking and screaming. I turned my eyes in another direction; but,
  nevertheless, I felt a strange sort of longing to revisit the tree.
  Anthony had ridden on, and was already hidden from view behind its
  branches. Presently I heard him give a loud shout of exultation. I
  jumped off my horse, and led it through a small opening in the
  leafage.</p>

  <p>Some forty paces from me the body of a man was hanging by a lasso
  from the very same branch on which Bob had been hung. It was not Bob,
  however, for the corpse was much too short and small for him.</p>

  <p>I drew nearer. &quot;Johnny!&quot; I exclaimed &quot;That&#39;s
  Johnny!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It <i>was</i>,&quot; answered Anthony. &quot;Thank Heaven,
  there&#39;s an end of him!&quot;</p>

  <p>I shuddered. &quot;But where is Bob?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bob?&quot; cried Anthony. &quot;Bob!&quot;</p>

  <p>He glanced towards the grave. The mound of earth seemed to me
  larger and higher than when I had last seen it. Doubtless the
  murderer lay beside his victim.</p>

  <p>&quot;Shall we not render the last service to this wretch,
  Anthony?&quot; asked I.</p>

  <p>&quot;The scoundrel!&quot; answered the huntsman. &quot;I
  won&#39;t dirty my hands with him. Let him poison the kites and the
  crows!&quot;</p>

  <p>We rode on.</p>

  <p>My first questions to Lafontaine, when I had his wound looked to,
  were of course for those whom he had left in England.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, ha!&quot; said he with a laugh, which showed the
  inextinguishable Frenchman, &quot;are you constant still? Well, then,
  Madame la Comtesse is constant too; but it is to her boudoir, or the
  gaieties of Devonshire House, or perhaps to her abhorrence of
  Monsieur le Mari.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Le Mari!&quot; I repeated the words with an involuntary
  start.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bah! &#39;tis all the same. She is affianced, and among us
  that tie is quite as legitimate as marriage, and, our libellers say,
  a little stronger. But they certainly are <i>not</i> married yet, for
  Mademoiselle Clotilde either is, or affects, the invalid; and
  considering the probability that she abhors the man and the match, I
  think, on the whole, that she acts diplomatically in informing the
  vainest colonel, in or out of France, that she is sick of any thing
  rather than of him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But your Mariamne&#8212;how go on your interests
  there?&quot; The question brought a smile and a sigh together, before
  he could find an answer.</p>

  <p>&quot;How she is, what she is doing, or intends to do, or even
  what she is, are matters that I can no more answer than I can why the
  wind blows. She torments me, and takes a delight in tormenting me. I
  have been on the point of throwing up my commission a hundred times
  since I saw you, and flying to America, or the world&#39;s end. She
  controls me in every thing, insists on knowing all my movements from
  hour to hour, finds them out when I attempt to conceal them as matter
  of duty, tortures me for the concealment, and then laughs at me for
  the confession. She is intolerable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And yet you have obtained a lengthening of your chain, or
  how come here? How long have you been in Paris?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Just two days; and busy ones, or I should have found you out
  before. Yes, I had Mariamne&#39;s full permission to come; though to
  this moment I cannot account for the change. I had received a sudden
  order from Montrecour, who is deep in the emigrant affairs, to set
  out with letters which could not be sent by the courier. But I dared
  not leave London without asking <i>her</i> permission; and I
  acknowledge asking her at the same time to run away with me, and give
  herself a lawful title to be my tyrant for life. Applying to Mordecai
  was out of the question. Her answer was immediate; contemptuous in
  the extreme as to my proposal, yet almost urgent on me to accept the
  mission, and lose no time between London and Paris. Her postscript
  was the oddest part of all. It was a grave recommendation to discover
  <i>you</i>, in whatever height or depth of the capital you might
  exist; whether you figured in the court or the cloister; were the
  idol of the maids of honour, or the model of the monks of La Trappe;
  to remind you that you had forgotten every body on the other side of
  the Channel who was worth remembering, including herself; and
  commending <i>me</i>, as a truant and a trifler, to your especial,
  grave, and experienced protection. Apropos! She sent me a letter, to
  be delivered to you with my own hands. But for yourself it had nearly
  failed in the delivery.&quot;</p>

  <p>He gave me the letter. It was, like the writer, a pretty
  <i>melange</i>; trifles gracefully expressed; strong sense expressed
  like trifles; feeling carried off with a laugh; and palpable and fond
  anxiety for Lafontaine couched in the most merciless badinage. While
  I gave this missive a second, and even <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_802" id="Page_802">[Pg 802]</a></span> a third
  perusal&#8212;for it finished with some gentle mention of the being
  whose name was a charm to my wearied spirit&#8212;my eyes
  accidentally fell on Lafontaine. His were fixed on me with an
  expression of inconceivable distress. At length his generous nature
  broke forth.</p>

  <p>&quot;Marston, if I were capable of jealousy, I should be jealous
  of <i>you</i> and of Mariamne. What <i>can</i> be the caprice which
  dictated that letter? what <i>can</i> be the interest which you
  evidently take in it? I wish that the bullet which laid me at your
  door this evening had finished its work, and put an end to an
  existence which has been a perpetual fever. I shall not ask
  <i>what</i> Mariamne has said to you&#8212;but <i>I</i> am
  miserable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but you <i>shall</i> ask, and shall have all you
  ask,&quot; said I, giving him the letter. &quot;It is the language of
  the heart, and of a heart strongly attached to <i>you</i>. I can see
  affection in every line of it. Of course she mingles a little
  coquetry with her sentiment; but was there ever a pretty woman, who
  was not more or less a coquette? She is a gem: never think it the
  less pure because it sparkles. Rely upon your little
  Mariamne.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then <i>you</i> have no sincere regard for her&#8212;no wish
  to interfere with my claims?&quot; said my pallid friend, dubiously
  extending his hand towards me.</p>

  <p>&quot;Lafontaine, listen to me, and for the last time on the
  subject. I have a very sincere regard for her.&quot; (My sensitive
  auditor started.) &quot;But, I have also a perfect respect for your
  claims. It is impossible not to acknowledge the animated graces of
  the lady on whom you have fixed your affections. But mine are fixed
  where I have neither hope to sustain them, nor power to
  change.&#8212;Those matters have nothing to do with choice. They are
  effects without a cause, judgments without a reason, influences
  without an impulse&#8212;the problems of our nature, without a
  solution since the beginning of the world.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But, Marston, you will only laugh at me for all my
  troubles.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Lafontaine, I shall do no such thing. Those pains and
  penalties have been the lot of some of the noblest hearts and most
  powerful minds that the earth has ever seen; and have been most
  keenly felt by the noblest and the most powerful. The poet only tells
  the truth more gracefully when he says&#8212;</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;&#39;The spell of all
    spells that enamours the heart,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">To few is imparted, to millions
    denied;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&#39;Tis the brain of the victim
    that poisons the dart,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And fools jest at that by which
    sages have died.&#39;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>&quot;But now, my friend, let us talk of other things. We must not
  sink into a pair of sentimentalists; these are terrible times. And
  now, tell me what brought you out of quiet England among our madmen
  here?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I may now tell all the world,&quot; was the reply, &quot;for
  the evil is done beyond remedy. I was sent by our friends in London,
  to carry the last warning to the royal family of all that has
  happened this day. My papers contained the most exact details, the
  names of the leaders, their objects, their points of assembling, and
  even their points of attack. Those were furnished, as you may
  conceive, by one of the principal conspirators; a fellow whom I
  afterwards saw on horseback in front of the Tuileries, and whom, I
  think, I had the satisfaction of dismounting by a shot from my
  carbine.&quot;</p>

  <p>I mentioned the fruitlessness of my own efforts to awake the
  ministry.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, with a melancholy smile, &quot;my friend,
  if you had been admitted into the palace, or into the council-chamber
  itself, you would have had precisely the same tale to tell. All was
  infatuation. I was ushered into the highest presence last midnight.
  My despatches were read. I was complimented on my zeal, and then was
  told that every thing was provided for. I was even closeted for two
  hours with the two individuals who, of all France, or of all mankind,
  had the largest stake in the crisis, and was again told that there
  was no crisis to be feared. I even offered to take a squadron of
  dragoons, and arrest the conspirators at the moment with my own hand.
  I saw the eyes of the noblest of women fill with tears of grief and
  indignation at the hopelessness of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_803" id="Page_803">[Pg 803]</a></span> my appeal, and the
  answer, &#39;that though Frenchmen might hate the ministers, they
  always loved their king.&#39; I saw that all was over.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Still,&quot; said I, &quot;I cannot comprehend how the mere
  mob of Paris could have succeeded against the defenders of the
  palace.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you had seen it as I did, the only wonder is, how the
  Tuileries held out so long. After passing a night on guard at the
  Pavilon de Flore, I was summoned at daybreak to attend his majesty.
  What a staff for a reviewing monarch! The queen endeavouring to
  support the appearance of calmness; Madame Elizabeth, that human
  angel, following her, dissolved in tears; the two royal children,
  weeping and frightened, making their way through the crowd of nobles,
  guardsmen, domestics who had gathered promiscuously in the chambers
  and corridors, armed with whatever weapons they could find, and all
  in confusion. From the windows there was another scene; and the only
  time when I saw the queen shudder, was when she cast her eye across
  the Place du Carrousel, and saw it covered with the dense masses of
  the multitude drawn up in battle-array. A more gloomy sight never met
  the eye. From time to time the distant discharge of cannon was heard,
  giving us the idea that some treachery was transacting in the remoter
  parts of the city, every discharge answered by a roar
  of&#8212;&#39;Down with the King&#39;&#8212;&#39;Death to Marie
  Antoinette&#39;&#8212;&#39;The lamp-iron to all traitors.&#39; While,
  as I glanced on those around me, I saw despair in every countenance;
  the resolution perhaps to die, but the evident belief that their
  death must be in vain. You now know all.&quot;</p>

  <p>I still expressed my strong anxiety to know what had been the
  events within the palace.</p>

  <p>&quot;Marston, I cannot think of them. I cannot speak of them. I
  see nothing but a vision of blood, shame, folly, wretchedness. There
  never was a cause more fatally abandoned. Every thing that could be
  done to ruin a monarchy was done. I was standing beside the royal
  group, when a deputation from the National Assembly made its
  appearance. At its head was a meagre villain, whom one might have
  taken for the public executioner. He came up, cringing and bowing, to
  the unfortunate king; but with a look which visibly said&#8212;We
  have you in our power. I could have plunged my sword in the
  triumphant villain&#39;s heart. I had even instinctively half drawn
  it, when I felt the gentle pressure of a hand on mine. It was the
  queen&#39;s. &#39;Remember the king&#39;s presence. We must owe
  nothing to violence,&#39; were her words. And at this instant she
  looked so heart-broken, yet so noble, that I could have worshipped
  her. The deputation pressed the necessity of &#39;taking
  shelter,&#39; as they phrased it, &#39;in the bosom of the faithful
  Assembly.&#39; The words, &#39;assembly of traitors,&#39; burst from
  my lips. A shout of approbation arose on all sides. But I was more
  rewarded by a sorrowing smile from the queen. She was indignant at
  the proposal. &#39;No; never shall I leave this spot but by the
  king&#39;s command!&#39; she exclaimed. &#39;I would rather be
  chained to the walls.&#39; As the guard pressed round her at the
  words, she suddenly stopped, took a pistol from one of the Garde du
  Corps, and forcing it on the king&#8212;&#39;Now,&#39; said the
  heroine&#8212;&#39;now is the time to show yourself a king of
  France!&#39; An universal cry of enthusiasm arose, and hundreds of
  swords were brandished in the air. The deputation, evidently
  expecting to be massacred, made an effort to reach the door, and the
  monarchy was on the point of being saved; when the leader of the
  party glanced back at the royal circle. There stood unfortunate
  Louis, hesitating, with the pistol in his hand. On such moments all
  depends. The villain crept up to the king, and whispered in his
  ear&#8212;&#39;Would you have all your family put to death? In the
  Assembly all are safe.&#39;&#8212;&#39;Well, then, we shall go,&#39;
  was the simple answer. He might have added&#8212;&#39;To the
  scaffold.&#39; The queen pressed her hands on her eyes, and wept
  bitterly. All were silent. In a few minutes more our sad procession
  was crossing the garden to the door of the Assembly, amid a roar,
  which could not have been fiercer or more triumphant had we been
  going to execution.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was already twilight; the fine summer&#39;s day, as if it had
  been dimmed by the desperate scenes of which it was witness, set in
  sudden clouds; and the distant shoutings of the populace <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</a></span> seemed
  to be answered by the voice of a storm. Lafontaine&#39;s wound began
  to bleed afresh by the agitation of his story, and to find medical
  assistance, was my first object. Having seen him conveyed to my bed,
  and leaving him in charge of my valet, I hastened towards the
  residence of the physician to the embassy. In doing this, I had to
  cross the Rue St HonorÃ©. But there my course was stopped. I shrink
  from alluding to those horrid scenes and times. The scene which there
  met my eyes has scarcely left them since.</p>

  <p>The populace were returning from the conquest and plunder of the
  palace to the Palais Royale, the headquarters of all convulsion; and
  they had arranged their ranks into something like a triumphal
  procession on the stage. The dead bodies of the brave Swiss were
  carried on boards or biers, preceded by banners of all kinds; the
  plundered ornaments of the Tuileries were borne on the heads of men;
  the horses from the royal stables, caparisoned for the occasion, drew
  hearses, in which the bodies of the mob who had fallen were
  deposited. Brief as the time for decoration had been, wreaths of
  artificial flowers, taken from the shops of the <i>marchandes de
  modes</i>, and theatrical shawls and mantles from the stores of the
  <i>fripiers</i>, covered the biers; and the whole, surrounded and
  followed by a forest of pikes and bayonets, plumes and flags, had no
  other light than the lurid and shifting blaze of thousands of torches
  tossing in the wild and howling wind.</p>

  <p>The train seemed endless; shocked and sickened, I had made
  repeated efforts to cross the column, but was repeatedly driven back.
  If all the dead criminality of Paris had risen to join all the
  living, it could scarcely have increased my astonishment at the
  countless thousands which continued to pour on before me; nor
  scarcely, if the procession had started from the grave, could it have
  looked more strange, squalid, haggard, and woebegone. In the rear
  came the cannon, which had achieved this melancholy victory. And
  they, again, were sometimes converted into the carriage of the dead,
  sometimes of the plunder, and, in every instance, were surmounted by
  women, female furies, drinking, shouting, and uttering cries of
  unspeakable savageness and blasphemy against priests, nobles, and
  kings; and, mingled with all this, were choruses of bacchanal songs,
  accompanied with shouts of laughter. It was now near midnight; and my
  anxiety for the condition of my unfortunate friend at last urged me
  to make a desperate attempt to force my way through the mass of pikes
  and daggers. After being swept far along with the stream, I reached
  the street in which the physician lived. He set out with me
  immediately, and, by his superior knowledge of the route, we were
  enabled to make our way unimpeded through streets, that looked like
  dens of robbers, to my hotel.</p>

  <p>But there a new and still more alarming disappointment awaited me.
  I found the porter and all the attendants of the establishment
  gathered on the stairs in terror. Lafontaine was gone! Whether,
  frenzied by the insults and yells of the populace, who continued to
  pass in troops from time to time, or anxious for my safety, he had
  started from his bed, put on his sword, and rushed into the street;
  without the possibility of being restrained, and without uttering a
  word of explanation.</p>

  <p>Exhausted as I was by fatigue, and still more by the sights and
  scenes through which I had just passed, this intelligence was a
  severe blow. The fate of a young enthusiast, and a foreigner, whom I
  had known but so lately, and of whom I knew so little, might not have
  justified much personal sacrifice. But the thought of the heart that
  would be broken by his falling into the hands of the barbarians, who
  were now masters of every thing, smote keenly upon me. Mariamne would
  die; and though I was by no means a lover of Mariamne, yet, where I
  had seen so much that was loveable, I might have a regard next in
  degree. There may, and does often, exist the tenderness of love
  without the flame. I could have looked on this pretty and animated
  creature as the wife of Lafontaine, or of any other object of her
  choice, without the slightest pang; but I could not have looked upon
  her pining away in hopelessness, wasting in silent sorrow, or with
  her gay and gentle existence clouded by a loss which nothing could
  repair, without thinking every effort of mine to avert <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</a></span> evil
  from her, due on every principle of common feeling.</p>

  <p>While I pondered, a note was brought to me, written by Lafontaine
  before he had sallied from his chamber, and evidently written under
  the wildest emotion. It told me, in a few scarcely legible words,
  that he felt life a burden to him, and thanked Heaven for the
  opportunity now offered of dying for his king and the glory of
  France. That the monarchy had perished beyond redemption. But that,
  though the royal family were surrounded by the poniards of assassins,
  it was his determination to follow and find them, rescue them, or die
  at their feet. This strange production closed with&#8212;&quot;You
  shall hear of me within twenty four hours, living or dead. If I fall,
  remember me to my affianced wife; and vindicate my character to the
  world.&quot;</p>

  <p>This was so like insanity, that it perplexed me more and more;
  but, on second thoughts, it appeared to offer some clue to his
  pursuit.&#8212;He had gone to die in presence of the royal family. If
  they were to be found by him at all, they must be found in the
  Assembly. I immediately went to the garden of the Tuileries, where
  they met until their new legislative palace should be erected. The
  multitude had now partially retired, for it was midnight; and the
  entrance was comparatively clear. A strong force of the National
  Guard still kept the drunken rabble at a distance; and the five franc
  piece, with which I tempted the incorruptibility of a peculiarly
  ferocious-looking patriot, admitted me without delay.</p>

  <p>What a scene there presented itself to my eyes! The
  &quot;Salle&quot; was large and showy; and when I had attended it in
  former debates, it exhibited the taste and skill which the French,
  more than any other people on earth, exhibit in temporary things.
  Nothing could exceed the elegance with which the Parisian decorators
  had fitted up this silk and tinsel abode, which was to be superseded,
  within a few months, by the solid majesty of marble. But, on this
  memorable and melancholy night, the ornaments bore, to me, the look
  of those sad frivolities with which France is fond of ornamenting her
  tombs. The chandeliers burned dim; the busts and statues looked
  ghostlike; the chief part of the members had thrown themselves
  drowsily on the benches; and the debate had languished into the
  murmurs of a speech, to which no one listened. If the loaded table,
  with its pile of petitions and ordonnances, in the midst of the hall,
  could have been imagined into a bier; the whole had the aspect of a
  <i>chapelle ardente</i>; there, indeed, lay in state the monarchy of
  France. My unlucky friend, of course, was not there; but I saw, in a
  narrow box, on the right of the president, a group, from which, when
  once seen, I found it impossible to withdraw my gaze&#8212;the first
  and most exalted victims of the Revolution, the king and his family.
  All but one were apparently overcome with fatigue; for they had sat
  there fifteen hours. But that one sat with a steady eye and an erect
  front, as if superior to all suffering. I had seen Marie Antoinette,
  the most splendid figure, in all the splendours of her court. I had
  seen her unshaken before vast popular assemblages, in which any rash
  or ruffian hand might have taken her life at the instant; but she now
  gave me an impression of a still higher order. Sitting in calm
  resignation and unstained dignity, her stately form and countenance,
  pale and pure as marble, looked like some noble statue on a tomb; or
  rather, sitting in that chamber of death, like some pure spirit,
  awaiting the summons to ascend from the relics of human guilt,
  infirmity, and passion before her.</p>

  <p>But the slumbers of the Assembly were soon to be broken. A tumult,
  and the tramping of many feet, was heard at the door. It was followed
  by the thunder of clubs and hammers breaking it in; the bars gave
  way; the huissiers and other attendants rushed through the body of
  the hall, and took refuge behind the chair of the president in
  affright; the sleepers started from their seats; and, with a roar
  which spoke the true supremacy of the new power in France, the mob
  poured in. They announced themselves a deputation from the
  Municipality, and instantly took possession of the benches. Men,
  women, and even children, composed this barbarian invasion; like all
  that I had seen, half intoxicated; but evidently trained by higher
  hands for more determined evil. A chosen set of orators, in Roman
  robes, probably plundered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_806"
  id="Page_806">[Pg 806]</a></span> from some suburb theatre, moved
  forward to the table, and took their seats round it in as much
  solemnity as conscript fathers. The chief speaker then advanced from
  the door, preceded by the head of one of the murdered Swiss on a
  pike, a hideous spectacle, and, drawing from his belt a dagger,
  commenced a furious harangue against every thing that bore the shape
  of authority in the kingdom. The Assembly did not escape in the
  general outpouring of its bitterness. They were charged with want of
  zeal, with want of honesty, and, most formidable of all, want of
  patriotism. I saw many a member cower at the word; for it was the
  countersign of Jacobinism; and the man, on whom that charge was
  personally fastened, was sure to fall by pistol or dagger. But the
  rage of the harangue was levelled at the royal family. &quot;There
  sits the tyrant!&quot; he exclaimed, pointing with his poniard to the
  meekest of monarchs and of men. &quot;The vengeance of the people
  calls for victims. How long shall it be insulted? If justice is
  blind, tear the bandage from her eyes. How long shall the sword of
  the people rust in its sheath! Liberty sitting on her altar demands
  new sacrifices to feed the flame. The blood of tyrants is the only
  incense worthy to be offered by a regenerated people!&quot;</p>

  <p>At every pause of those fierce interjections, the crowd burst into
  yells of applause, drew knives and daggers from their bosoms,
  flourished them in the air, and echoed the words. The Assembly were
  evidently held in terror of their lives. The president made some
  faint attempts to restore order. A few of the members made faint
  attempts at speeches. But the mob were masters; and a night of such
  horrors passed, as I had never dreamed of before. At daybreak the
  orator demanded that a decree should be instantly passed, suspending
  the king, the ministry, and even the Assembly, in the midst of which
  he stood. Of all the extravagances ever conceived&#8212;of all the
  insolences of power&#8212;of all the licenses of popular
  licentiousness, this was the most daring, unrivalled, and unimagined;
  and yet this was carried, with scarcely a voice raised against it.
  The trembling president, with the dagger at his throat, put the
  motion for extinguishing the throne, the cabinet, and calling a new
  Assembly! From that hour the monarchy was no more.</p>

  <p>During this tremendous discussion, I had not ventured to raise my
  eyes towards the royal family; but, as all were now about to retire,
  I dared a single glance. The king was slowly leaving the box, leading
  the dauphin by the hand; the Princess Elizabeth was carrying the
  sleeping dauphiness in her arms; the queen stayed behind, alone, for
  a moment, sitting, as she had done for hours, with her eyes fixed on
  vacancy, and her countenance calm, but corpselike. At length she
  seemed to recollect that she was alone, and suddenly started up. Then
  nature had its way; she tottered, and fainted. From that night forth,
  that glorious creature never saw the light of day but through the
  bars of a prison. From the Feuillans, the royal family were consigned
  to the cells of the Temple, from which Louis and Marie Antoinette
  never emerged but to the grave!</p>

  <p>This night taught me a lesson, which neither time nor circumstance
  has ever made me forget. It cured me of all my republican fantasies
  at once, and for ever. I believe myself above the affectation of
  romantic sensibility. But it would not be less affectation to deny
  the feelings to which that awful scene of human guilt and human
  suffering gave birth. If the memory of the popular atrocities made me
  almost abhor human nature, the memory of that innocent and
  illustrious woman restored my admiration of the noble qualities that
  may still be found in human nature. &quot;If I forget thee even in my
  mirth,&quot; the language of the Israelite to his beloved city, was
  mine, in scarcely a less solemn or sacred spirit, in those hours of
  early experience. Let the hearts and eyes of others refuse to
  acknowledge such feelings. I am not ashamed to say, that I have shed
  many a tear over the fate of the King and Queen of France. In the
  finest fictions of genius, in the most high-wrought sorrows of the
  stage, I have never been so deeply touched, I have never felt myself
  penetrated with such true and irresistible emotion, as in reading,
  many a year after, the simplest record of the unhappy Bourbons.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[Pg
  807]</a></span> What must it be, to have witnessed the last agonies
  of their hearts and throne!</p>

  <p>On returning to my chamber, shuddering and wretched, I found a
  despatch on my table. It was from Downing Street; an order, that
  within twelve hours after its receipt, I should set out from Paris,
  and make my way, with the utmost secrecy, to the headquarters of the
  Austrian and Prussian army; where further orders would be waiting for
  me.</p>

  <p>This command threw me into new perplexity. It had been my purpose
  to find my unfortunate friend, if he was not already in the bosom of
  the Seine, or a victim to some of the popular violences. But my
  orders were peremptory. I, however, did all that was in my power. I
  spent the day in looking for him through all the hotels and
  hospitals; and, after a hopeless search, gave my man of mystery,
  Mendoza, a commission&#8212;paid for at a rate that made him open his
  hollow eyes wide with incredulity on the coin&#8212;to discover and
  protect him, wherever he was to be found.</p>

  <p>But I had now another difficulty which threatened to nip my
  diplomatic honours in the bud. The news had just arrived, that the
  allied armies had passed the frontier, and were sweeping all before
  them with fire and sword. A populace is always mad with courage, or
  mad with cowardice; and the Parisians, who, but yesterday, were ready
  to have made a march round the globe, now thought the wells and
  cellars of the city not too deep, or too dark to hold them. They
  would have formed a camp in the catacombs, if they could. All was
  sudden terror. The barriers were shut. Guards were posted tenfold at
  all the gates. Men were ranged on the heights round the city, to make
  signals of the first approach of the Prussian hussars; and the
  inhabitants spent half the day on every house top that commanded a
  view of the country, waiting for the first glimpse of their
  devourers. To escape from this city of terror now became next to
  impossible. All my applications were powerless. The government were
  themselves regarded as under lock and key; the populace, as if
  determined that all should share a common massacre, were clustered at
  the barriers, pike in hand, to put all &quot;emigrants&quot; to
  death; the ambassador was, as ambassadors generally are in cases of
  real difficulty, a cipher; and yet I <i>must</i> leave Paris within
  twelve hours, or be cashiered.</p>

  <p>It at length occurred to me to avail myself of my Jewish spy, and
  I found him listening to a midnight harangue in the midst of a
  Jacobin crowd, in the Palais Royal. He considered the matter for a
  while; and I walked about, leaving him to his free invention, while I
  contrasted the brilliant blaze of the gaming and dancing-rooms above
  me with the assassin-like darkness of the galleries below. At length
  he turned to me. &quot;There is but one way. Have you any objection
  to be arrested?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The greatest imaginable,&quot; was my answer.</p>

  <p>&quot;Just as you please,&quot; he replied; &quot;but I have here
  an order for the seizure of one of the emigrant agents, a Chevalier
  Lafontaine, lately arrived in Paris. He has been seen in the palace,
  but we have missed him for the last twelve hours. The order is for
  Vincennes. Will you take his place?&quot;</p>

  <p>I naturally looked all surprise, and peremptorily refused.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do as you will,&quot; said my intractable adviser; &quot;but
  there is no other way to pass the gates. I shall take you to
  Vincennes as a state prisoner; I have influence there. In short, if
  you trust me, you shall be safe, and on your road by daybreak. If you
  do not, here your life is uncertain; you are known, watched, and the
  first order that I receive to-morrow, may be one for your
  apprehension.&quot;</p>

  <p>All this was likely enough; there was but a moment to deliberate,
  and I got into the first cabriolet, and drove with him to the
  barrier. The streets still exhibited scattered bands, who questioned
  us from time to time, but the words, &quot;By order of the
  Municipality,&quot; which were enough to terrify the stoutest hearts,
  and the display of his badge, carried us through. We passed the guard
  at the gate, after a slight examination of the order, and galloped to
  Vincennes.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the frowning fortress my blood chilled, and I
  refused to go further. &quot;In that case,&quot; said my conductor,
  &quot;<i>I</i> am compromised, and <i>you</i> are ruined; the first
  patrol will seize you, while I shall be shot. I pledge myself, that
  here you shall not remain; but I must be acquitted to the head of the
  police. You shall <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_808" id=
  "Page_808">[Pg 808]</a></span> be M. le Chevalier Lafontaine for the
  night; and, if such a man exists, you will probably be the means of
  saving his life. To-morrow I shall bring proofs of my mistake, and
  then you will be outside the walls of Paris, and free to go where you
  please.&quot;</p>

  <p>The name of Lafontaine decided me. Even the risk seemed less
  serious than before, and we drove over the drawbridge. The interior
  of the fortress formed a striking contrast to the scenes which I had
  just left behind me. All was still stern, and noiseless.</p>

  <p>&quot;Give me your papers,&quot; said Mendoza; &quot;they will be
  safer in my hands than in yours.&quot;</p>

  <p>I had but time to give him my despatch, as we passed through the
  court which led to the governor&#39;s apartments. I was searched in
  the presence of that important functionary, a meagre old captain of
  invalids, who had been roused from his bed, and was evidently half
  asleep. I stoutly denied my being &quot;the criminal who had offended
  the majesty of the people.&quot; But as the governor himself, on
  gazing at me with his purblind eyes, was perfectly satisfied of my
  identity, there was no use in contesting the point. A couple of
  sentinels were placed at the door of my cell, and I was left, like
  himself, to my slumbers. Before the door closed, I grasped my guide
  by the throat. The thought that I had been entrapped, actually
  agonized me.</p>

  <p>&quot;Am I betrayed?&quot; I asked, in a whisper of fury.</p>

  <p>The only answer was, &quot;Mordecai.&quot;</p>

  <p>I felt security in the word, and, without a further pang, heard
  his tread echoing along the distant corridor.</p>

  <p>Time rolls on, whether we are happy or miserable. Morning came,
  and found me feverish from a thousand dreams. Noon came, and my
  impatience grew with the hour. Evening came, and yet no symptom of my
  liberation. If, &quot;hope deferred maketh the heart sick,&quot;
  confidence duped, and blindly, weakly, rashly duped, turns to
  torture.</p>

  <p>Why trust a known agent of the police? Why put my liberty into his
  hands? Why, above all, make him master of my papers? I was
  overwhelmed with shame. I writhed with remorse. As hour after hour
  dragged into slow length along, I sank from dejection to dejection,
  or burst from rage to rage. But at last, when the drums of the
  garrison were making their final flourish for the night, the key
  turned in the door of my cell, and the Jew entered. I almost sprang
  upon him, and his life would have been worth little, but for the
  words&#8212;&quot;You may now leave the fortress.&quot; He told me,
  further, that my absence was fortunate, for a domiciliary visit had
  been paid to my apartments by direction of the municipality; my
  trunks examined, and my doors sealed. My absence was imputed to
  flight; and, as jails were then the only safe residences in France, I
  had escaped actual imprisonment simply by my volunteer detention; to
  watch the event, had been the source of his delay. All was speedily
  settled with the old commandant, who was now as perfectly
  &quot;convinced, on his own knowledge,&quot; that I was not the
  chevalier, as he had been convinced on the night before that I was.
  Mendoza&#39;s proofs were registered in due form; and with
  unspeakable delight I once again mounted his cabriolet, and heard the
  chains of the drawbridge rattle behind me.</p>

  <p>My Jew had been true to his pledge. I found horses provided for me
  at a lonely cabaret, a league off. With the minute foresight which
  men of his trade learn, he had provided for me a couple of
  disguises&#8212;the garb of a peasant, which I was to use when I
  passed among the soldiery; and the uniform of an aide-de-camp, with
  which I was to keep down enquiries when I came among the peasantry.
  But I was weary of disguise. It had never thriven with my
  temperament. I was determined, at all events, now to trust to chance
  and my proper person; and if I must fail, have the satisfaction of
  failing after my own style. The only recompense which my magnanimous
  police-officer would receive, was a promise that I should mention his
  conduct to Mordecai; and, gathering up his rejected wardrobe, he
  departed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately I found disguises unnecessary, though at any other
  time they might have been essential. The country was all in a state
  of flight, and every man was too much employed in securing himself,
  to think of laying hold of others. Thus galloped I through hill and
  dale, through bush and brier, unquestioned and almost unseen; until,
  on the evening of the fourth day, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_809" id="Page_809">[Pg 809]</a></span> as I plunged into a
  forest, which for the last half hour I had been imagining into a
  scene of fairyland, a bower where a pilgrim might finish his journey
  for life, or a man, &quot;crazed by care, or crossed in hopeless
  love,&quot; might forget woman and woe together&#8212;I was awakened
  to the realities of things by the whistle of a bullet, which struck
  off a branch within an inch of my head, followed by a fierce howl for
  the countersign. By all the laws of war, the howl should have come
  first; but these were not times for ceremony. A troop of Hulans
  rushed round me, sabre in hand. I stood like a stoic; and, of course,
  attempted to tell who I was. But my German was unintelligible to my
  captors, and my French, a suspicious language on a Prussian outpost,
  only confirmed their opinion that I was born to be stripped.
  Accordingly one demanded my watch, another my purse, and I was in a
  fair way of entering the Prussian lines in a state of pauperism, or
  of being &quot;left alone in my glory&quot; by shot or sabre, when an
  officer rode up, whom I had casually known in some Parisian circle.
  To him I could explain myself, and to him I exhibited the envelope of
  my letter, inscribed with the words, &quot;Grand Quartier
  General.&quot; My new friend bowed to this awful address like a Turk
  to the firman of the padisha, poured out a volley of wrath on the
  troop, ordered the instant and very reluctant restitution of my
  property, and with a couple of the squadron at our heels, took me
  under his escort, to deliver my papers in person.</p>

  <p>After an hour&#39;s gallop through rocks, rivulets, and brambles,
  which seemed without end, and totally uninhabited, except by an
  occasional patrol of the irregulars of the Austrian and Prussian
  forces&#8212;barbarians as savage-looking as ever were Goth or Hun,
  and capital substitutes for the wolves and wild-boars which they had
  ejected for the time&#8212;a sudden opening of the forest brought us
  within view of the immense camp of the combined armies.</p>

  <p>All the externals of war are splendid; it is the interior, the
  consequences, the operation of that mighty trampler of man that are
  startling. This was my first sight of that most magnificent of all
  the atrocious inventions of human evil&#8212;an army. The forces of
  the two most warlike monarchies of Europe were spread before me;
  nearly a hundred and fifty thousand troops, with all the numberless
  followers of a host in the field, covering a range of low hills which
  circled the horizon. While we were still at a considerable distance,
  a gun was fired from the central hill, answered by others from the
  flanks. The rolling of drums set the vast line in motion, and just at
  the moment when the sun was lying on the edge of the west, the
  brigades, descending each from its height, halted on the slope. The
  whole vast manoeuvre was executed with the exactness of a single
  mind. The blaze of the sun on the arms, the standards, and the tents
  crowning the brow of the hills, was magical. &quot;Are they marching
  to battle?&quot; was my amazed question to my companion. His only
  answer was to check his charger, take off his shako, and bend his
  forehead to his saddle-bow. A burst of universal harmony, richer than
  I had ever yet conceived, explained the mystery. It was the evening
  prayer. The fine bands of the regiments joined the voices of the
  soldiery, and I listened, in unbroken rapture and reverence, until
  its close. In court or cathedral, in concert or shrine, I had never
  before so much felt the power of sound. It finished in a solemn
  chorus, and accumulation of music. I could have almost imagined it
  ascending, embodied, to heaven.</p>

  <p>The fire of cannon announced the conclusion of the service; we put
  spurs to our horses, and soon entered the lines; and, on the strength
  of my credentials, I had distinguished quarters assigned to me.</p>

  <p>I now, for the first time since I left England, began to feel the
  advantages of birth. In London every man is so submerged in the
  multitude, that he who can hold his head high enough out of the
  living surge to be known, must have something of remarkable buoyancy,
  or peculiar villany, about him. Even Parliament, except to a few of
  the leaders, is no distinction. The member for the shire is clipped
  of all his plumage at the moment of his entering that colossal
  poultry-yard, and must take his obscure pickings with other
  unnoticeable fowl. In Paris, once the Mahometan paradise of stars and
  garters, the central herald&#39;s office of the earth, the royal
  region of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_810" id=
  "Page_810">[Pg 810]</a></span> Parliament aristocracy, where the
  beggar with a <i>cordon</i> on his breast outshone the banker with
  millions in his pocket-book, the world was changed; and to be the son
  or brother of a peer might have been only a speedier passport to the
  lamp-post. But, in Germany, the land of pedigrees, to be an
  &quot;honourable&quot; was to be one on whom the sun shone with
  double beams; the sex, young and old, smiled with double softness and
  the whole host of Serenities were doubly serene. In camp, nothing
  could be more hospitable or distinguished than my reception; for the
  soldier is always good-humoured under canvass, and the German is
  good-humoured every where. Perhaps he has rather too high an opinion
  of his descent from Goth and Vandal, but he makes allowance for the
  more modern savagery of Europe; and although the stranger may neither
  wear spectacles, nor smoke cigars, neither muzzle his visage with
  mustaches, nor speak the most formidable tongue on earth, the German
  will good-naturedly admit, that he may be a human being after
  all.</p>

  <p>But the man with whom my mission brought me most immediately into
  contact, and to whom I was most indebted for courtesy, would have
  been a remarkable personage in any country of Europe; that man was
  the Duke of Brunswick.</p>

  <p>On my arrival, I found two letters forwarded from London, and in
  the hands of an aide-de-camp of the generalissimo. The first which I
  opened was from the Foreign Office, a simple statement of the purpose
  for which I was sent&#8212;namely, to stimulate the activity of the
  Prussian councils, and to urge on the commander of the army an
  immediate march on the French capital; with a postscript, directing
  me, in case of tardiness being exhibited at headquarters, instantly
  to transmit a despatch home, and return to my post in Paris. The
  second letter&#8212;which I must, however undiplomatically, admit
  that I opened with much stronger interest&#8212;was from Mordecai. I
  glanced over it for some mention of the &quot;ane braw name,&quot;
  and bitterly laughed at my own folly in expecting to find such
  communications in the letter of the hard-headed and busy Jew. All was
  brief and rapid.</p>

  <p>&quot;If this shall find you in the Prussian camp, you will have
  no more time for me than I have for you. Let me not clip your
  diplomatic hopes; but this I forewarn you, you will not obtain a
  single object of your journey; except, perhaps, showing that you can
  gallop a hundred miles in the four-and-twenty hours, and can make
  your way through a country of lunatics without being piked or
  sabred.</p>

  <p>&quot;The campaign is over already&#8212;over before it was begun.
  The battle was fought in the council at Berlin, and the allies were
  beaten. The duke, within the next fortnight, will be deciding on the
  merits of the ballet in Brunswick, and the French will be madder than
  ever with triumphs which they never won, preparing for conquests
  which are already gained, and knocking down thrones, the owners
  themselves supplying the pickaxes and hammers. You will see the two
  best armies of the Continent running away from their own shadows; the
  old councillors of Frederick and Maria Theresa baffled by cabinets of
  cobblers and tinkers; grey-beard generals, covered with orders,
  hunted over the frontier by boys, girls, and old women; and France,
  like a <i>poissarde</i> in a passion, with her hair flying about her
  ears, a knife in her hand, and her tongue in full swing, scampering
  half naked over Europe, to the infinite wonder of the wearers of
  velvet, Mechlin lace, and diadems,&#8212;ha, ha, ha!&quot;</p>

  <p>While I was trying to decipher this riddle, which was rather too
  contemptuous for my new views of things, but which I referred to the
  habitual feelings of a strong-headed man in humble life, brought just
  close enough to higher to feel his exclusion, an officer was
  announced as Count Varnhorst, on the staff of the duke. His
  countenance struck me at first sight, as one which I had seen before;
  and I soon discovered, that when I was a boy at Eton, he had been on
  a visit of a few days at Mortimer castle, in the suite of one of the
  Prussian princes. We had been thus old friends, and we now became
  young ones within the first quarter of an hour. His countenance was
  that of a humourist, and his recollections of the Great Frederick
  rendered him sarcastic on all things of the later generation.</p>

  <p>&quot;The duke has sent me for you,&quot; said he, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[Pg 811]</a></span>
  &quot;with his apology for keeping you out of bed; but he has
  appointed midnight for the delivery of your despatches. The truth is,
  that hitherto we have all slept so soundly, that we must make up for
  lost time by turning night into day now, just as we have turned day
  into night for the last twelvemonth.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But what can you tell me of the duke?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh! a great deal; but you know that I am on his staff, and
  therefore bound to keep his secrets.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yet, count, remember that we have sworn an eternal
  friendship within the last five minutes. What can he or I be the
  worse for my knowing his great and good qualities?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear young friend, when you are as old as I am, you will
  see the improprieties of such questions.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, then, to come to the point; is he a great
  general?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He speaks French better than any other prince in
  Germany.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is he an able politician?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You must see him on horseback; he rides like a
  centaur.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, then, in one sentence, will he fight the
  French?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That wholly depends on whether he turns his horse&#39;s head
  towards Paris or Berlin.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Count, but one question more, which you may answer without a
  riddle. Do you think that he will receive my mission
  cordially?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He speaks your language; he wears your broad cloth; he loves
  your porter; and he has married one of your princesses.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All my difficulties are answered. I am ready; but what shall
  I find him doing at this extraordinary hour?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If asleep, dreaming of the opera at Brunswick; if awake,
  dreaming of the opera at Paris.&quot;</p>

  <p>His diamond repeater, which he had laid on the table between us,
  struck twelve as he spoke; and, wrapping ourselves in our cloaks, we
  sallied forth into one of the most starry nights of autumn, and made
  our way, through long ranges of patrols and videttes, to the quarters
  of the generalissimo.</p>

  <p>The mansion was an old chateau, evidently long abandoned to
  loneliness and decay one of those huge edifices; whose building had
  cost one fortune, and whose support had exhausted another. But the
  struggle had been over for the last fifty years, and two or three
  shrivelled domestics remained to keep out the invasion of the bats
  and owls. But at this period the chateau exhibited, of course,
  another scene; aides-de-camp, generals, orderlies, couriers&#8212;all
  the clang and clamour of the staff of a great army&#8212;rang through
  the wild old halls, and echoed up the long ghostly corridors. Every
  apartment was a blaze of light, and filled with groups of officers of
  the Prussian and Austrian guards; all was billiard-playing, talking,
  singing in chorus, and carousing in all the noisy gaiety of the
  soldier in good quarters.</p>

  <p>&quot;All this is tempting enough,&quot; said the old count, as we
  hastened along a gallery that seemed endless, but on which the open
  doors of the successive apartments threw broad illumination. &quot;I
  dare say, Mr Marston, that you would prefer taking your seat among
  those lively fellows, to the honour of a ducal conference; but my
  orders are, that you must not be seen until the duke gives you
  <i>carte blanche</i> to appear among human beings again.&quot;</p>

  <p>The count now opened the door of an apartment, which appeared to
  have been more lately tenanted than the rest, yet which exhibited
  signs of the general desertion; a marble table, covered with a
  decaying drapery, a Carrara alabaster of Niobe and her children on
  the mantelpiece, a huge mirror, and a tapestry of one of the hunts of
  Henri Quatre, showed that Time had been there, and that the Prussians
  had not; but the indistinct light of the single chandelier left me
  but little opportunity of indulging my speculations on the furniture.
  The count had left me, to ascertain when the duke should be at
  leisure to receive me; and my first process was, like a good soldier,
  to reconnoitre the neighbouring territory. The first door which I
  opened led into a conservatory, filled with the remnants of dead
  foliage, opening on the gardens of the chateau, which, wild as they
  now were, still sent up a fragrance doubly refreshing, after the
  atmosphere of meershaums, hot brandy, and Rhine beer, which filled
  the galleries. The casement distantly overlooked the esplanade in
  front of the chateau; and the perpetual movements of the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[Pg 812]</a></span>
  couriers and estafettes, arriving and departing every moment, the
  galloping of cavalry, and the march of patrols, occupied me until a
  valet of the duke came to acquaint me that supper was served, by his
  highness&#39;s commands, in the apartment which I had lately quitted,
  and that he would be present in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>I returned of course; and found the chamber which I had left so
  dark and dilapidated, changed, as if by a fairy wand, into pomp and
  elegance. The duke was renowned for splendid extravagance, and the
  table was covered with rich plate, the walls glittered with a
  profusion of gilt lamps, and all round me had the look of regal
  luxury. But one object suddenly caught my gaze, and left me no power
  to glance at any other. In a recess, which had hitherto been obscure,
  but over which now blazed a brilliant girandole, hung a full-length
  portrait of a nun, which, but for the dress, I should have pronounced
  to be Clotilde; the same Greek profile, the same deep yet vivid eye,
  the same matchless sweetness of smile, and the same mixture of
  melancholy and enthusiasm, which had made me think my idol fit to be
  the worship of the world. I stood wrapped in astonishment, delight,
  pain, a thousand undefined feelings, until I could have almost
  imagined that the canvass before me lived. I saw its eye all but
  glisten, its lips all but open to speak; the very marble of its cheek
  begin to glow; when I was awakened by a lively voice, saying, in
  French&#8212;&quot;Ah, Mr Marston, I perceive that you are a
  connoisseur.&quot; I turned, and saw the speaker, a man somewhat
  above the middle size; a remarkably noble-looking personage; in full
  dress even at that hour, powdered and perfumed, and altogether a
  court figure; his hands loaded with jewels, and a diamond star of the
  order of the garter upon his breast. It required no introducer to
  tell me that I was in the presence of the Duke of Brunswick.</p>

  <p>&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;we have no time for etiquette,
  nor indeed for any thing else to-night&#8212;we must sup first, and
  then talk of your mission.&quot;</p>

  <p>We sat down; a double file of valets, in liveries, loaded with
  embroidery, attended at the table; though the party consisted of but
  four; Varnhorst, and a Colonel Guiseard, chief of the secret
  diplomacy, a pale Spanish-featured officer&#8212;to whom his highness
  did me the honour of introducing me, as the son of one of his old
  friends.</p>

  <p>&quot;You remember Marston,&quot; said he, &quot;at Brunswick,
  five-and-twenty years ago, in his envoyship&#8212;a capital horseman,
  a brilliant dresser, and a very promising diplomatist. I augured well
  of his future career, but&quot; &#8212;&#8212;the infinite elevation
  of the ducal shoulders, and the infinite drooping of the ducal eyes,
  completed the remainder of my unfortunate parent&#39;s history; but
  whether in panegyric or censure, I was not sufficiently versed in the
  science of saying nothing and implying all things, to tell. Guiseard
  fixed his deep sallow eye on me, without a word: at that moment he
  reminded me exactly of one of the Inquisitors&#8212;the deep,
  dark-visaged men whom the matchless pencil of Velasquez has
  immortalized.</p>

  <p>Varnhorst burst out into a laugh.</p>

  <p>&quot;What, Guiseard,&quot; said he, &quot;are you reconnoitring
  the ground before you make the attack? Your royal highness, I think
  we ought to vindicate our country to this English gentleman, by
  assuring him that the colonel is not a cardinal in
  disguise.&quot;</p>

  <p>The colonel merely smiled, which seemed an effort for his
  cloistered physiognomy; the duke laughed, and began a general
  conversation upon all possible topics&#8212;England forming the
  chief; the royal family&#8212;the court&#8212;the
  theatres&#8212;parliament&#8212;the people&#8212;all whirled over
  with the ease and rapidity of one turning the leaves of an album;
  here a verse and there a portrait&#8212;here a sketch of a temple,
  and there an outline of a cottage&#8212;the whole pretty, and as
  trifling as pretty, and cast aside at the first moment when any thing
  better worth thinking of occurred.</p>

  <p>In the midst of our gaiety, in which the duke had completely laid
  down his sceptre, and taken his full share, the great clock of the
  chateau tolled one. The table was instantly swept of supper&#8212;the
  valets withdrew. I heard the tread of a sentinel at the door of the
  apartment; and the duke, instantly changing from the man of fashion
  to the statesman, began to enter into the questions then so deeply
  disturbing all the cabinets of Europe.</p>

  <p>I found the duke a very superior <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_813" id="Page_813">[Pg 813]</a></span> man to what I had
  conceived of him. He was frank and free, spoke of the intentions of
  the Allies in the most open manner, and censured the errors which
  they had already committed, with a plainness which I had not expected
  to find out of London. He had evidently made himself master of a
  great variety of knowledge, and with the happy but most unusual power
  of rendering it all applicable to the point in question. My
  impressions of him and his order, imbibed among the prejudices of
  England and the libels of France, was that of frivolity and
  flutter&#8212;an idle life and a stagnant understanding. I never was
  more surprised at the contrast between this conception and the
  animated and accomplished prince before me. He seemed to know not
  merely the persons of all the leading men of Europe&#8212;which might
  have naturally been the case with one who had visited every
  capital&#8212;but to be acquainted with their characters, their
  abilities, and even their modes of thinking. He seemed to me a man
  born to rule. It was in later days that the habits of a voluptuary,
  of which his peculiar love of dress might have been slightly
  symptomatic, produced their effect, in enfeebling a mind made for
  eminence. I saw him afterwards, broken with years and misfortune. But
  on this night I could only see a man on whom the destinies of Europe
  were rightly reposed. I pay this tribute of honour to his memory.</p>

  <p>He spoke a great deal, in our conference, on the necessity of a
  strong European combination against France, and flatteringly
  addressed to me a strong panegyric on my country.</p>

  <p>&quot;If we can obtain,&quot; said he, &quot;the cordial
  co-operation of the English people, I see no difficulty before us. We
  already have the Ministry with us; but I know the Englishman&#39;s
  hatred of a foreign war, his horror of public expenditure on
  continental interests, and his general distrust of the policy of
  foreign courts. And until we can give the people some evidence, not
  only that our intentions are sincere, but that our cause is their
  own, we shall never have the nation on our side.&quot;</p>

  <p>My remark was, &quot;that the chief difficulty with the nation
  would be, to convince them that the Allied Powers were not influenced
  by personal motives; I said that the seizure of territory, while the
  French remained in their defenceless state, would probably excite
  strong public displeasure in England; and plainly stated, that the
  only thing which could engage the public spirit in the war, would be
  a conviction of its absolute justice and stern necessity.&quot;</p>

  <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the arrival of a
  staff-officer with despatches from Berlin. A number of papers were
  laid on the table, and handed over to Varnhorst and Guiseard to read.
  They proved chiefly notes and orders relative to the advance of the
  army. One paper, however, the duke read with evident interest, and
  marked with his pencil down the margin.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am delighted,&quot; said he, &quot;that this paper has
  reached us at last. Mr Marston will now see what my real advice has
  been from the beginning. The French journals have attacked me
  furiously for the declaration issued at our entrance on the frontier.
  The journals of England have partly echoed the French, and I am held
  up to the world as the author of the <i>Declaration of Pilnitz</i>.
  This paper, which Mr Marston will do me the honour to send at
  daybreak to his court by a special messenger, will clear my character
  with his countrymen at once&#8212;with the rest of Europe, I am
  content to wait a little longer.&quot;</p>

  <p>He then read the paper in his hand; and it was a long and striking
  protest against the idea of partitioning France, or having any other
  intention in the movement of the troops than the security of the
  French throne. This document had been sent to the Council at Berlin,
  and been returned by them for revision by the duke, and the softening
  of its rather uncourtly decisiveness of expression. It stated, that
  even the conquest of France, if it could be effected, must be wholly
  useless without the conciliation of the people: that it must be
  insecure, that it never could be complete, and that even the attempt
  might rouse this powerful people to feel its own force, and turn its
  vast resources to war. The first measure ought, therefore, to be an
  address to the nation, pronouncing, in the clearest language, an
  utter abjuration of all local seizure.</p>

  <p>The paper thus returned, and containing the observations of the
  council, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[Pg
  814]</a></span> was given to Varnhorst, to be copied. &quot;And
  now,&quot; said the duke, &quot;gentlemen, I think we may retire for
  the night; for we have but three hours until the march in the
  morning.&quot;</p>

  <p>I said some common-place thing, of the obligations which Europe
  must owe to a sovereign prince, exposing himself to such labours,
  honourable as they were.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; he smilingly replied; &quot;they are part of our
  office, the routine of the life of princes, the vocation of men born
  for the public, and living for the public alone. The prince must be a
  soldier, and the soldier must make the camp his home, and the palace
  only his sojourn. It is his fortune, perhaps his misfortune, that but
  one profession in life is left open to him, whether it be the bent of
  his temperament or not&#8212;while other men may follow their tastes
  in the choice, serve their fellows in a hundred different ways, and
  raise a bloodless reputation among mankind. And now, good-night.
  To-morrow at five the <i>advance</i> moves. At six I shall be on
  horseback, and then&#8212;Well! what matter for the <i>then</i>? We
  shall sleep at least to-night; and so, farewell.&quot;</p>
